The conversation starts with the customer asking a question, and the agent responds directly to the issue without introducing themselves or acknowledging the customer in a professional manner. There is no greeting phrase used by the agent at the start of the interaction, which is a missed opportunity to set a positive tone for the call. 

To improve, the agent should begin the call with a polite and professional greeting. For example, they could say, ""Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx.

Customer: ""But isn't it possible to place an order from the branches as well?""
Agent: ""Sir, you just need to share your ID and password. As per the current rules, you don't need to share your credentials.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The customer asked if it was possible to place an order from the branches, but the agent responded with information about sharing credentials, which was not relevant to the customer's question. This indicates that the agent did not fully understand or address the customer's query about placing orders from branches.

Let me know if you need further assistance with this process.""",0,"The agent used the phrase 'Thank you for calling Choice. Thank you so much.' for closure. This closure is insufficient because it does not follow the closure guidelines of asking if there is anything else the customer needs assistance with or wishing them a good day. Additionally, the agent did not inform the customer about the feedback request, which is part of the closure guidelines. 

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.'",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates minimal empathy towards the customer. Throughout the conversation, the agent focuses primarily on technical instructions and procedural details without acknowledging the customer's frustration or concerns. For example, when the customer expresses issues with the app loading and the inconvenience it causes, the agent does not use any empathetic language such as ""I understand how frustrating this must be for you"" or ""I apologize for the inconvenience."" Instead, the agent repeatedly asks for time to check the issue and provides instructions without addressing the emotional aspect of the customer's experience.

The agent could improve empathy by using phrases like ""I can see why this is frustrating, and I'm here to help you through it"" or ""I understand this is causing you trouble, and I appreciate your patience while we resolve it."" This would help the customer feel heard and understood, rather than just being given technical solutions.",3,"The agent maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempted to address the customer's issues. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy.

1. **Acknowledging Frustration**: The agent did not acknowledge the customer's frustration or inconvenience at any point. Phrases like ""I understand this is frustrating for you"" or ""I apologize for the inconvenience"" could have helped to calm the customer.

2. **Clarity and Reassurance**: The agent's responses were sometimes repetitive and lacked clarity. For example, when the customer asked about placing an order, the agent repeated the same information without providing additional reassurance or explanation. Instead, the agent could have said, ""I understand your concern about placing orders. Let me guide you through the process to ensure everything goes smoothly.""

3. **Empathy and Assurance**: The agent could have been more empathetic and reassuring, especially when the customer expressed concerns about the app issue affecting many clients. A response like ""We are aware of the issue and are working hard to resolve it as quickly as possible"" would have been more effective.

Overall, while the agent was polite, they missed opportunities to show empathy and provide clearer, more reassuring communication, which would have improved the customer's experience.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not greet the customer according to the script. The script specifies a formal greeting with the agent's name and company, which was not followed. Instead, the conversation started abruptly with the customer asking a question. The agent should have started with, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification**: The agent failed to perform the verification step as outlined in the script. The script requires the agent to confirm the identity of the caller, especially if the call is from a non-registered number, by verifying specific details. The agent did not follow this process. The agent should have asked, ""May I confirm, is this Mr. XYZ speaking?"" or proceeded with the verification process for non-registered numbers.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The script emphasizes allowing the client to express their concerns fully without interruption. The agent interrupted the customer and did not reconfirm the query as per the script. The agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the customer's query. The script requires the agent to summarize the issue to ensure understanding. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did provide a solution, but it was not clear and concise as per the script's guidance. The agent should have clearly stated the solution and any further steps they would take.

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs help with and thanking them for their time. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent significantly deviated from the script, particularly in greeting, verification, listening, and closure, leading to a score of 2 for limited adherence.","1) 1secs to 11 secs transcript not captured properly(agent voice was very low)
2) 32 secs to 48 secs transcript not captured.

The agent also fails to keep the conversation focused on solving the problem effectively. While they do eventually say they will raise the issue with the Consent Department, this comes after a series of unclear exchanges that could have been avoided with clearer communication from the start.

Overall, the agent's tone and choice of words could be improved to better manage the customer's frustration and provide a more professional and empathetic service experience.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies: ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" The agent said, ""Good morning, this is Choice Connect. How can I help you?"" This is a deviation from the script as the company name and phrasing were incorrect.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Good Morning, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not listen to the query properly. The customer had to repeat themselves, and the agent interrupted with ""Sorry, sir. What are you saying? Tell me clearly."" This is not in line with the script's instruction to let the client express themselves fully before responding.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have allowed the customer to finish their explanation and then reconfirmed the query.

3. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not clearly reconfirm the query as per the script. The script suggests summarizing the query, but the agent did not do this effectively.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: your payment of ₹6,355 is not reflecting in your wallet. Let me check that for you.""

4. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did provide a solution by stating they would raise it with the Consent Department, which aligns with the script's intent to provide a solution.

5. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script specifies asking if there is anything else the customer needs and thanking them for their time. The agent simply said, ""Thank you for calling ChoiceWorks. Have a nice day.""
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, particularly in greeting, listening, and closure, which justifies a score of 2.",

  - Customer inquired about the amount requested, which was $49.50.
  - Customer mentioned it had been 3-4 days since the request was made.
  - Customer confirmed the requested amount was $1500 but stated it was not in their account.
  - Customer provided account number 1528 and expressed concern about the balance not reflecting the requested amount.

- **Solutions provided by the agent**:
  - The agent informed the customer that they could only assist with correcting spelling and providing information.
  - The agent did not address the specific concerns raised by the customer regarding the missing funds.
  - The agent abruptly ended the call without providing a resolution to the customer's issue.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'How much amount did you request?', 'agent_solution': 'The customer requested an amount of $49.50.'}, {'query': 'When did you take it?', 'agent_solution': 'The customer mentioned that it has been 3-4 days since the transaction, possibly on a Friday.'}, {'query': 'What success are you showing?', 'agent_solution': 'The customer is inquiring about the status of a $1500 transaction that is not reflecting in their account.'}, {'query': 'Is it not in your account?', 'agent_solution': ""The agent confirmed that the amount is not showing in the customer's account with the number ending in 1528.""}]}",0,"The agent did not provide any greeting at the beginning of the call. The transcript starts with the agent asking for an ID and then immediately moving into the conversation without any formal introduction or greeting. This is inadequate as it lacks professionalism and does not set a positive tone for the interaction. A proper greeting is essential to make the customer feel welcomed and valued.

To improve, the agent should start the call with a polite and professional greeting. For example, they could say, 'Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would help in establishing a courteous and professional interaction from the outset.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** The agent repeatedly says, ""Wait a minute. It's not in my balance. It's the same."" This shows a lack of understanding and acknowledgment of the customer's issue. The customer is trying to explain that the amount is not in their account, but the agent keeps repeating the same phrase without addressing the concern.

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The agent did not acknowledge the customer's concern about the missing amount in their account. Instead, they kept repeating the same phrase, which did not provide any clarity or solution to the customer's problem.

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""I understand that you are saying the amount of $1500 is not reflecting in your account number 1528. Let me check the transaction details for you and see what might have gone wrong."" This would show that the agent is actively listening and taking steps to resolve the issue.",0,"The agent used the phrase ""Thank you for calling Choice."" for closure. This is insufficient because it does not ask if the customer has any other questions or needs further assistance, nor does it provide a warm farewell or request feedback, which are essential components of proper closure according to the guidelines provided. The agent also did not inform the customer about the feedback request (CSAT). This leaves the interaction feeling abrupt and incomplete, potentially leaving the customer unsatisfied with the service experience. 

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrated no empathy towards the customer. The conversation was highly mechanical and lacked any acknowledgment of the customer's emotions or concerns. The agent repeatedly asked for information without addressing the customer's frustration or confusion about the missing funds. 

Problematic Phrases:
- The agent did not use any empathetic language or phrases that acknowledged the customer's distress about the missing money.
- The repeated phrase ""Wait a minute"" was used without any reassurance or explanation, which could increase the customer's anxiety.
- The agent ended the call abruptly with ""Thank you for calling Choice,"" without resolving the issue or showing any understanding of the customer's situation.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- The agent could have said, ""I understand how concerning it must be to not see the funds in your account. Let me look into this for you right away.""
- Instead of repeatedly saying ""Wait a minute,"" the agent could have provided updates or reassurances, such as ""I'm checking the details now, thank you for your patience.""
- Before ending the call, the agent should have ensured the customer felt heard and reassured, perhaps by saying, ""I will make sure this issue is resolved and follow up with you as soon as possible."" This would have shown a commitment to resolving the issue and understanding the customer's concerns.",1,"The agent's performance in this transcript is poor, warranting a score of 1. The conversation is disjointed and lacks any clear attempt to address the customer's concerns or frustrations. The agent fails to acknowledge the customer's issue regarding the missing amount in their account, and there is no evidence of empathy or an attempt to resolve the problem. The agent's responses are repetitive and do not provide any useful information or reassurance to the customer.

Specific issues include:
- The agent does not acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion about the missing funds. A more empathetic approach would be to say, ""I understand this is frustrating for you. Let me check the details and see how I can assist you.""
- The agent repeatedly says ""Wait a minute"" without providing any follow-up or resolution, which can be perceived as dismissive. Instead, they could have said, ""Let me look into this for you, and I'll update you shortly.""
- The conversation ends abruptly with ""Thank you for calling Choice,"" without any resolution or assurance that the issue will be addressed.

Overall, the agent's lack of engagement and failure to address the customer's issue effectively escalates the situation rather than calming it.",1,"The agent's adherence to the script was extremely poor, warranting a score of 1. Here are the justifications for this score:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not greet the customer at all. According to the script, the agent should have started with a greeting such as ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" or the Hindi equivalent. This was completely omitted.

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The transcript shows a lack of understanding and engagement with the customer's issue. The script instructs the agent to allow the client to express their concerns fully without interruption, which was not followed.

3. **Reconfirming the Query**: There was no attempt to reconfirm the customer's query. The script requires the agent to summarize the issue to ensure understanding, which was not done.

4. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent attempted to address the issue, the response was unclear and did not follow the script's guidance to provide a clear and concise solution. The agent should have said, ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

5. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script suggests ending the call with ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!"" This was not done, and the call ended abruptly.

6. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: There was no mention of a feedback request, which is part of the script.

Overall, the agent failed to follow the script in almost every aspect, leading to a score of 1 for complete non-adherence. The agent should have adhered to the script by greeting the customer, listening and reconfirming the query, providing a clear solution, and closing the call properly.",

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- The agent provided a detailed breakdown of the customer's recent trades, including the amounts traded, losses incurred, and resulting account balance.
- The agent explained the calculation of brokerage charges and clarified that charges were imposed per lot, not per trade.
- The agent patiently walked the customer through the losses in trading crude oil and Nifty, explaining the calculations step by step.
- The agent guided the customer to check his Ledger for a detailed overview of the transactions and assured him that the amounts reflected were accurate.

The greeting used was 'Good morning, sir. My name is Aishwarya, and I am from Banerjee.' This greeting is courteous and includes the agent's name, which helps in establishing a personal connection with the customer. It also sets a professional tone for the conversation. To improve, the agent could include the company name, Choice Finx, to provide more context and clarity about the call's purpose, aligning with the reference greetings provided. For example, 'Good morning, sir. My name is Aishwarya, and I am calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?'

The customer repeatedly expresses confusion about the calculations and asks for clarification, saying, ""I don't understand, madam, this calculation."" The agent responds with, ""Sir, please open your Ledger. First of all, open your Ledger. The Ledger must be made by you, not mine. You. I don't understand, ma'am, this calculation. Please open your Ledger, sir. Please open your Ledger.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The agent fails to acknowledge the customer's confusion and does not provide a clear explanation or assistance. Instead, the agent repeatedly instructs the customer to open their Ledger without addressing the customer's request for clarification on the calculations.

**Suggested improvement:**
The agent could have said, ""I understand you're having trouble with the calculations. Let me walk you through it step by step. We can start by reviewing the transactions together. Would you like me to explain how the amounts were calculated?"" This would show empathy and a willingness to assist the customer in understanding the issue.",0,"The agent did not provide any closure statement at the end of the call. There was no attempt to ask if the customer needed further assistance or to thank the customer for their time. Additionally, there was no mention of a feedback request or CSAT survey, which is part of the closure guidelines. The conversation ended abruptly with the agent confirming the customer's understanding of the calculations, but without any formal closure or invitation for further questions or feedback requests, leaving the interaction incomplete and potentially unsatisfactory for the customer. 

Suggested Improvement: The agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services."" This would have provided a more complete and courteous closure to the call.",1,"The agent, Aishwarya, demonstrated a lack of empathy throughout the call. The conversation was heavily focused on technical details and calculations without acknowledging the customer's confusion or frustration. Specific phrases that highlight this include:

1. ""Yes, sir. Properly checked."" - This response is dismissive and does not address any potential concerns the customer might have about the accuracy of the information.

2. ""Please open your Ledger, sir. Please open your Ledger."" - Repeatedly instructing the customer to open their ledger without offering assistance or understanding their difficulty is unhelpful and lacks empathy.

3. ""Everything is proper in your bills; any proper amount is being reflected."" - This statement dismisses the customer's confusion and does not offer any reassurance or support.

The agent could have improved empathy by using phrases like, ""I understand this can be confusing, let me help you through it,"" or ""I can see why this might be frustrating, let's go through it step by step together."" These responses would acknowledge the customer's feelings and offer more personalized assistance.",3,"The agent, Aishwarya, maintains a generally polite tone throughout the conversation, but there are several areas where her professionalism and ability to manage the customer's frustration could be improved. 

1. **Acknowledgment of Frustration**: The customer expresses confusion and frustration multiple times, saying things like ""I don't understand, madam, this calculation."" Aishwarya does not directly acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion, which could have helped in calming the situation. Instead of repeating instructions, she could have said, ""I understand this can be confusing, let me walk you through it step by step.""

2. **Clarity and Patience**: The conversation is filled with numbers and calculations, which can be overwhelming. Aishwarya could have broken down the information more clearly and slowly, ensuring the customer follows along. For example, instead of saying, ""Please open your Ledger,"" she could have said, ""Let's go through your Ledger together to ensure everything is clear.""

3. **Empathy and Reassurance**: The agent could have used more empathetic language to reassure the customer. Phrases like ""I understand your concern"" or ""Let me help clarify this for you"" were missing, which are crucial in maintaining a calm and professional demeanor.

Overall, while Aishwarya remains polite, she misses opportunities to directly address the customer's frustration and provide reassurance, which are key aspects of excellent customer service.",1,"The agent's adherence to the script was extremely poor, warranting a score of 1. Here are the justifications for this score:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies a structured greeting, including the agent's name and the company name, ""Choice Finx."" Instead, the agent said, ""Good morning, sir. My name is Aishwarya, and I am from Banerjee,"" which deviates significantly from the script. The agent should have said, ""Good Morning, this is Aishwarya calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification**: Although verification was not required in this call, the agent did not follow any verification process as outlined in the script for registered or non-registered numbers.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The script advises the agent to allow the client to express their concerns fully without interruption. However, the transcript shows the agent frequently interrupting and not fully understanding the customer's concerns. The agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the customer's query as per the script. The script suggests summarizing the customer's issue to ensure understanding, which was not done. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent did provide some information, it was not clear or concise as required by the script. The agent should have provided a structured solution based on the customer's query.

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure to the call. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs and thanking them for their time. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

The agent introduced themselves as 'Aman from Burakhnut Price Broking,' which is not the correct company name, indicating a lack of professionalism and potential confusion for the customer. The greeting phrase used was: 'Good morning, I am Aman from Burakhnut Price Broking. How can I help you?' This does not reflect the company the agent is representing, which is Choice Finx. 

To improve, the agent should ensure they correctly identify the company they are representing in their greeting. A more appropriate greeting would be: 'Good Morning, this is Aman calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you?' This would ensure clarity and professionalism in the interaction.",0,0,"The agent failed to listen properly in the following part: **""Can I have your registered mobile number? Where? Here. Can I have your registered mobile number? Give me your helmet. I will check, sir. Please stay on the line.""** This shows the agent did not properly listen to the customer's query because they repeated the request for the registered mobile number without acknowledging the customer's confusion or providing clarification. Instead, the agent could have said, ""I understand there might be some confusion. Could you please provide your registered mobile number so I can assist you further?"" This would have acknowledged the customer's confusion and provided a clear request for the necessary information.",0,"The agent concluded the call with 'Alright, sir. Thank you for calling Choice Finx.' This closure lacks the standard closure guidelines, such as asking if there is anything else the customer needs assistance with or wishing the customer a good day. Additionally, the agent did not mention any feedback request or CSAT survey, which is part of the closure guidelines for a complete and satisfactory closure experience for the customer. The closure was abrupt and did not ensure the customer felt fully supported or valued after the interaction, nor did it encourage feedback that could help improve services in the future. 

Suggested Improvement: The agent could have said, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.' This would have provided a more complete and customer-friendly closure.",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrated a lack of empathy towards the customer. Throughout the conversation, the agent focused solely on technical details and did not acknowledge the customer's frustration or concerns. For example, when the customer expressed confusion and concern about the withdrawal status, the agent simply stated, ""I'll check, sir. You please stay on the line,"" without any acknowledgment of the customer's feelings or situation.

Additionally, the agent repeatedly asked for the registered mobile number without addressing the customer's apparent confusion or frustration, as seen in the exchange: ""Where? Here. No, not here. What is your registered mobile number? I don't know. I don't know."" This indicates a lack of active listening and understanding of the customer's state of mind.

The agent could have improved empathy by using phrases like, ""I understand this is concerning for you,"" or ""I can see why you're worried about the delay,"" to acknowledge the customer's emotions. Furthermore, providing reassurance, such as ""I will do my best to resolve this quickly for you,"" would have shown a more empathetic approach.",3,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates average control over the conversation. They maintain a polite tone throughout and attempt to address the customer's concerns. However, there are several areas where the agent could improve their professionalism and empathy:

1. **Acknowledging the Customer's Frustration**: The agent does not acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion about the withdrawal status. A phrase like ""I understand this is concerning for you, and I'm here to help"" would have been more empathetic.

2. **Clarity and Patience**: The agent repeats questions and instructions, which could confuse the customer. For example, the repeated request for the registered mobile number could have been handled more smoothly. Instead of saying ""Where? Here. Can I have your registered mobile number? Give me your helmet,"" the agent could have said, ""Could you please provide your registered mobile number so I can assist you further?""

3. **Professionalism in Communication**: The agent's language is sometimes unclear, such as ""Give me your helmet,"" which seems out of context and unprofessional. Ensuring clear and relevant communication is crucial.

4. **Providing Information**: When discussing brokerage charges, the agent could have proactively offered to connect the customer with the Relationship Manager or offered to send the details via email or SMS, rather than just providing a number.

Overall, while the agent remains polite, they miss opportunities to enhance the customer's experience by being more empathetic and clear in their communication.",1,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. Instead of introducing themselves as from Choice Finx, the agent said, ""Good morning, I am Aman from Burakhnut Price Broking. How can I help you?"" The script requires the agent to say, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" The agent should have used the correct company name and followed the script.

2. **Verification**: The agent failed to perform the verification step as per the script. The script requires the agent to confirm the identity of the caller, especially if the number is not registered. The agent asked for the registered mobile number but did not follow through with the verification process as outlined in the script. The agent should have confirmed the identity by asking for 3 out of 5 details if the number was not registered.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The customer mentioned a withdrawal issue, but the agent did not summarize or confirm the query as required by the script. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

4. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent did provide a solution regarding the withdrawal issue, they did not follow the script's structure. The script requires a clear and concise solution after confirming the query. The agent should have thanked the customer for their patience and then provided the solution.

5. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script requires the agent to ask if there is anything else they can assist with and thank the customer for their time. The agent ended the call with ""Alright, sir. Thank you for calling Choice Finx,"" which does not align with the script's closure requirements.

Overall, the agent did not adhere to the script in multiple key areas, resulting in a score of 1 for complete non-adherence. The agent needs to follow the script more closely, especially in greeting, verification, and closure, to ensure a consistent and professional customer experience.",

- The customer, VJ, is concerned about the status of their account, specifically whether it has been opened or not.
- VJ mentions that the account was opened using a bank's app and wants clarification on the process.

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- The agent, Ambika, confirms that the account has been opened and assures VJ that the account is active.
- Ambika offers to send a message to VJ for further confirmation and provides the email address for any inquiries or feedback.
- The agent also mentions the services provided by Choice, such as Choice Finx, BTST, and Choice Broking, and offers assistance with regulatory bodies like SEBI.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'My account is in trash.

The greeting used was: 'Hello, good afternoon, sir. I am Veda Bhatt. Tell me, how can I help you?' This greeting is courteous and aligns well with the reference greetings provided. It includes a polite salutation, the agent's name, and an offer of assistance, which is professional and helpful. To improve, the agent could mention the company name, Choice Finx, to make the greeting more complete and informative, as per the reference examples.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** ""Ma'am, I want to check if your account is open in Equity or Mutual Funds. Sir, I will check and let you know. I don't have any information about the mutual funds from our department. I will check and let you know.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The customer initially mentioned that their account is in 'trash,' indicating a problem or confusion with the account status. Instead of addressing this concern, the agent immediately jumps to checking if the account is open in Equity or Mutual Funds without clarifying the customer's initial statement about the account being in 'trash.'

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""I understand you're saying your account is in 'trash.' Could you please explain what you mean by that, so I can assist you better?"" This would have shown that the agent was listening and trying to understand the customer's actual concern before proceeding with any checks.",0,"The agent concluded the call with ""Thank you so much for a very good result. I will request you to give us your feedback."" This closure is insufficient because it does not include a clear offer for further assistance or a proper farewell. Additionally, the feedback request is not clearly communicated as a post-call survey or message, which could confuse the customer about how to provide feedback. The agent also did not use the standard closure phrases provided in the guidelines, such as asking if there is anything else they can assist with or wishing the customer a good day, which are important for ensuring the customer feels the interaction is complete and satisfactory. 

Suggested Improvement: The agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services."" This would provide a clear closure and a structured feedback request, aligning with the guidelines provided.",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrated a lack of empathy throughout the interaction. The conversation was very transactional, focusing solely on technical details without acknowledging the customer's emotions or frustrations. For instance, when the customer mentioned their account was 'in trash,' the agent did not acknowledge the potential frustration or confusion this might cause. Instead, the agent immediately moved to technical questions about the account type.

Moreover, the agent's responses were mechanical and lacked any empathetic language. Phrases like 'I will check and let you know' and 'Tell me your number once' are purely functional and do not convey any understanding or concern for the customer's situation.

To improve empathy, the agent could have used phrases like, 'I understand how concerning it must be to find your account in such a state. Let me help you resolve this,' or 'I can see why this situation is frustrating, and I'm here to assist you.' These responses would have acknowledged the customer's feelings and shown a willingness to help beyond just solving the technical issue.",3,"The agent, Veda Bhatt, maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation, which is a positive aspect. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy.

1. **Acknowledging the Customer's Frustration**: The agent did not acknowledge the customer's initial frustration about their account being in 'trash.' A more empathetic response could have been, ""I understand you're concerned about your account status. Let me help you with that.""

2. **Clarity and Structure**: The conversation lacked structure, with the agent jumping between different topics without clear transitions. For example, when the customer asked about the account status, the agent could have said, ""Let me verify your account details first, and then I'll provide you with the information you need.""

3. **Providing Clear Instructions**: When the customer was asked to provide their number, the agent could have guided them more clearly by saying, ""Please provide your full phone number so I can check your account details.""

4. **Professional Closure**: The agent ended the call by asking for feedback, which is good, but they could have reinforced the resolution by summarizing the steps taken and confirming the customer's satisfaction, e.g., ""I'm glad we could resolve your issue. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out.""

Overall, while the agent was polite, they missed opportunities to show empathy and provide a more structured and clear interaction, which is why the score is 3 for average control.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies a structured greeting with the agent's name and company, but the agent simply said, ""Hello, good afternoon, sir. I am Veda Bhatt. Tell me, how can I help you?"" The agent should have said, ""Good Afternoon, this is Veda Bhatt calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not listen to the customer's query properly. The customer mentioned their account was in 'trash', but the agent did not address this concern directly. Instead, the agent asked about the account type without acknowledging the customer's initial statement. The agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you.""

3. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the customer's query. The script requires the agent to summarize the customer's issue to ensure understanding, which was not done. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

4. **Providing a Solution**: The agent provided a solution but did not follow the script's structure. The script suggests providing a clear and concise solution, but the agent's response was fragmented and unclear. The agent should have said, ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

5. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs and thanking them for their time. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, with limited adherence to the structured process outlined in the script. The agent needs to follow the script more closely to ensure a consistent and professional customer service experience.",

- The customer had initially sent a withdrawal request in the morning, which was in auto-pending status but got automatically cancelled.
- The customer is concerned about why the withdrawal request was cancelled without their action.

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- The agent reassured the customer that withdrawals are not automatically cancelled and suggested that if it was cancelled, it might have been done from the client's side.
- The agent offered to check with the back-end team to investigate why the withdrawal request was cancelled.
- The agent advised the customer to send the withdrawal request again but requested the customer to stay on the line while they verify the issue with the team.
- The agent asked the customer to wait for confirmation before sending the request again to ensure a smooth process.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'I have a fund available in the Choice application.

The greeting used was: 'Good afternoon, Choice Broking. This is Aman speaking. How can I help you?' This greeting is courteous, provides the agent's name, and invites the customer to state their issue, aligning well with the reference greetings provided. To improve, the agent could ensure they maintain this level of professionalism consistently and perhaps personalize the interaction by using the customer's name if known, which can enhance the customer experience further.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** ""So, it doesn't get canceled because the payment that you put for withdrawal is processed ahead. If it is canceled, then it is canceled from the client's side; it doesn't get canceled automatically.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The agent immediately assumes that the cancellation must have been done from the client's side without fully investigating the issue or acknowledging the customer's concern that they did not cancel it. This response dismisses the customer's claim and does not show understanding or empathy.

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""I understand your concern about the cancellation. Let me thoroughly check with our back-end team to find out why this happened and ensure it wasn't an error on our side. Please hold on while I investigate this further.""",0,"The agent did not provide any closure to the call. The conversation ended abruptly with the agent asking the customer to stay on the line, but there was no follow-up or conclusion to the interaction. The agent did not ask if there was anything else the customer needed help with, nor did they thank the customer for their time or mention any feedback request, which are essential components of proper closure according to the guidelines provided. The call ended without any resolution or clear next steps communicated to the customer, leaving the interaction incomplete and potentially unsatisfactory for the customer. 

The exact phrase used for closure was: ""Sir, I request you to please stay on the line. A lot better, decent. Hello. Hello."" This is not a closure statement but rather an indication that the call was still ongoing or had technical issues, and it does not provide any finality or assurance to the customer.

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services."" This would ensure the customer feels the interaction is complete and valued, and it encourages feedback for service improvement.",2,"The agent, Aman, demonstrated minimal empathy throughout the call. While he acknowledged the customer's issue, he did not use any empathetic language or phrases to show understanding of the customer's frustration. For example, when the customer expressed confusion and concern about the cancellation of their withdrawal request, Aman simply stated, ""It doesn't get canceled automatically,"" without acknowledging the customer's feelings or offering reassurance.

The agent could have improved empathy by using phrases like, ""I understand how concerning this must be for you,"" or ""I can see why this situation is frustrating."" This would have shown the customer that their feelings were being recognized and validated.

Additionally, Aman could have personalized his responses by saying, ""Let me make sure we get this sorted out for you,"" which would have conveyed a sense of partnership and commitment to resolving the issue. Instead, his responses were mostly procedural and lacked a personal touch, focusing more on the technical aspects of the problem rather than the customer's emotional experience.",3,"The agent, Aman, maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempted to address the customer's issue by checking with the back-end team. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy.

1. **Acknowledging the Customer's Frustration**: Aman did not acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion about the cancellation. A phrase like ""I understand this is frustrating for you, and I'm here to help"" would have been more empathetic.

2. **Clarity and Assurance**: The agent's explanation about the cancellation was somewhat unclear and could have been more reassuring. Instead of saying, ""If it is canceled, then it is canceled from the client's side; it doesn't get canceled automatically,"" Aman could have said, ""Let me investigate why this happened, as it should not cancel automatically without your action.""

3. **Repetitive Phrasing**: The agent repeated phrases like ""please stay on the line"" and ""let me check this first"" without providing new information or reassurance. This could make the customer feel like they are not being heard. A more effective approach would be to provide a brief update or reassurance, such as ""I'm currently checking with our team to ensure we resolve this for you as quickly as possible.""

Overall, while the agent was polite, there was a lack of empathy and clarity in communication, which are crucial for maintaining professionalism and calming the customer.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies a structured greeting with the agent's name and company, but the agent simply said, ""Good afternoon, Choice Broking. This is Aman speaking. How can I help you?"" The agent should have said, ""Good Afternoon, this is Aman calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The customer explained their issue, but the agent did not summarize or reconfirm the query as per the script. The script suggests saying, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

3. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did attempt to provide a solution by checking with the back-end team, which aligns with the script's intent to provide a solution. However, the agent did not clearly communicate the solution or next steps to the customer.

4. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure to the call. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs and thanking them for their time, which was not done. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, particularly in greeting, listening, and closure, resulting in a score of 2 for limited adherence to the script. The agent needs to follow the script more closely to ensure a consistent and professional customer experience.",

  - Suresh Bharadwaj contacted the agent regarding an issue with withdrawing money from his Choice Broking account.
  - He also requested the activation of the derivative segment in his account.
  - Suresh inquired about the process of activating the segment and whether he needed to upload any documents for verification.

- **Solutions provided by the agent**:
  - The agent informed Suresh that he couldn't withdraw the same day he added funds and advised him to wait until the next day to process the withdrawal.
  - The agent guided Suresh on how to activate the derivative segment through the Choice Broking application.
  - Sudeeksha instructed Suresh to tick the segments he wanted to activate, including Equity, Derivatives, NSE, and BSE, and submit a request along with a 6-month bank statement.
  - When Suresh mentioned not having the bank statement at the moment, the agent advised him to arrange it and upload it later for verification.
  - The agent clarified that there were no other options for income proof verification other than the bank statement.
  - Sudeeksha concluded the call by thanking Suresh and asking for his feedback on the call experience.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'I am withdrawing money from my Choice Broking account, but it is not going through.', 'agent_solution': 'The agent informed the customer that since the funds were added today, they cannot be withdrawn on the same day.

To improve, the agent could include the company name in the greeting to provide more context to the customer, such as 'Good afternoon, sir. This is Sudeeksha from Choice Finx. How can I help you?'

The agent repeatedly asked, ""How much amount have you deposited, sir?"" and ""How much money have you invested?"" without addressing the customer's initial concern about the issue with withdrawing money.

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The customer clearly stated, ""I am withdrawing money from it, but it is not withdrawing,"" indicating an issue with the withdrawal process. Instead of addressing this concern, the agent diverted to asking about the deposit amount, which was not directly relevant to the customer's immediate issue.

**Suggested improvement:**
The agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing an issue with withdrawing money from your account. Let me check that for you."" This would acknowledge the customer's concern and show that the agent is focused on resolving the specific issue raised by the customer.",0,"The agent used the phrase ""Okay, thank you so much, sir. Have a very good day. Please share your daily rating on the call."" for closure. This closure is insufficient because it does not explicitly ask if the customer has any other questions or needs further assistance, which is a key part of providing proper closure. Additionally, the feedback request is not clear or specific about how the customer should provide their feedback or rating, and it does not mention the importance of the feedback for service improvement, as per the guidelines.

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""",1,"The agent, Sudeeksha, demonstrated a lack of empathy throughout the call. She focused solely on technical details and procedural instructions without acknowledging the customer's emotions or frustrations. For instance, when the customer expressed difficulty with withdrawing money, the agent did not acknowledge the inconvenience or frustration this might cause. Instead, she immediately moved to explain the technical reason without any empathetic language.

Problematic phrases include:
- ""There is an issue with withdrawing money, sir."" This statement is purely factual and lacks any empathetic acknowledgment of the customer's potential frustration.
- ""You cannot payout on the same day because you have added the amount today, 5000. So, till tomorrow, you will have to pay."" This explanation is technical and dismisses the customer's immediate concern without any empathetic engagement.

The agent could have improved empathy by saying something like, ""I understand how frustrating it must be to not be able to withdraw your money immediately. Let me explain why this is happening and what we can do to resolve it."" This would show that she acknowledges the customer's feelings and is there to help, rather than just providing technical instructions.",3,"The agent, Sudeeksha, maintained a generally polite tone throughout the conversation, but there were several areas where her professionalism and ability to manage the call could have been improved. 

1. **Repetitive Phrasing**: The agent repeatedly asked, ""Tell me, how can I help you?"" even after the customer had already stated the issue. This could make the customer feel unheard. Instead, she could have acknowledged the issue more directly, saying, ""I understand you're having trouble withdrawing money. Let's see how we can resolve this.""

2. **Lack of Empathy**: There was little to no expression of empathy or understanding of the customer's frustration. Phrases like ""I understand this can be frustrating"" or ""Let me help you with that"" would have been beneficial.

3. **Guidance on Process**: While the agent provided step-by-step instructions, she could have been more patient and ensured the customer was following along, especially when the customer seemed confused about the process. Phrases like ""Take your time, and let me know if you need any help"" would have been more supportive.

4. **Closure**: The call ended abruptly without a clear resolution or assurance. The agent could have ended with, ""If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.""

Overall, while the agent was polite, there was a lack of empathy and proactive problem-solving, which are crucial for a higher score.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies a structured greeting with the agent's name and company, but the agent simply said, ""Good afternoon, sir. This is Sudeeksha. How can I help you?"" The agent should have said, ""Good Afternoon, this is Sudeeksha calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The customer had to repeat themselves, indicating the agent was not fully attentive. The script advises allowing the client to finish speaking without interruption, which was not adhered to.

3. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the customer's query as per the script. The script suggests summarizing the query to ensure understanding, which was not done. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing an issue with withdrawing money from your account. Let me check that for you.""

4. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did provide a solution regarding the withdrawal issue and segment activation, which aligns with the script's intent. However, the explanation was somewhat fragmented and could have been more structured.

5. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs help with and thanking them for their time. The agent's closure was abrupt and did not include a feedback request. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services."" 

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, particularly in greeting, listening, reconfirming the query, and closure, leading to a score of 2 for limited adherence to the script. The agent needs to follow the script more closely to ensure a consistent and professional customer experience.",

- Agent advises the customer to send an email with details of the referral and the missing voucher query.

The conversation starts abruptly with 'Sir? Yes? On interest money, sir.' This does not include any introduction or polite greeting, which is essential for setting a professional tone and making the customer feel welcomed and valued. A proper greeting should include the agent's name, the company name, and an offer of assistance, such as 'Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would help in establishing a professional and courteous interaction from the start. The agent should ensure to use such a structured greeting in future interactions to improve customer experience.",0,0,"The agent did not listen properly to the customer's query. The customer repeatedly mentioned that they opened an account through a referral and are not receiving updates, but the agent kept insisting that the customer is a franchise person and provided a separate contact number for franchise support. **Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** ""But, sir, I am telling you that you are a franchise person. So, your connection is different, sir."" This shows the agent did not properly understand the customer's situation and incorrectly categorized them as a franchise person. **Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""I understand you opened an account through a referral and are not seeing updates. Let me check your account details and see why the lead has not been added."" This would have acknowledged the customer's actual issue and provided a path towards resolution.",0,"The agent did not provide any closure statement to the customer. The conversation ended abruptly without any form of closure or feedback request, leaving the customer without a clear end to the interaction or any encouragement to provide feedback on the service received. The agent failed to ask if there was anything else the customer needed help with or to thank the customer for their time, which are essential components of proper closure according to the guidelines provided. Additionally, there was no mention of a feedback request, which is also part of the closure guidelines.

Suggested Improvement: The agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services."" This would have provided a clear and courteous end to the conversation and encouraged the customer to provide feedback.",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates a lack of empathy towards the customer. Throughout the conversation, the agent focuses primarily on technical details and procedural instructions without acknowledging the customer's frustration or confusion. For example, the agent repeatedly asks the customer to contact a different line without addressing the customer's immediate concerns or expressing understanding of their situation. The agent also fails to use any empathetic language, such as ""I understand this must be frustrating for you,"" or ""Let me see how I can help you with this issue."" Instead, the agent's responses are mechanical and lack personalization.

To improve empathy, the agent could have said, ""I can see why this situation is confusing and frustrating for you, Mr. Dharamveer. Let me help clarify this for you and see what we can do to resolve it."" This approach would acknowledge the customer's feelings and show a willingness to assist beyond just providing procedural information.",3,"The agent maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation but struggled to effectively address the customer's concerns and frustrations. The agent repeatedly asked the customer to clarify their issue without providing clear guidance or acknowledging the customer's frustration. For example, the agent could have used phrases like ""I understand this is frustrating for you"" or ""Let me help you resolve this"" to show empathy and calm the situation. Additionally, the agent seemed to provide repetitive information about contacting a different line, which could have been streamlined to avoid confusion. Overall, while the agent remained polite, they missed opportunities to demonstrate empathy and provide a more structured resolution path, resulting in an average control score.",1,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The call started abruptly with 'Sir? Yes?' instead of the scripted greeting, 'Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?'. The agent should have started with the proper greeting to set a professional tone.

2. **Verification**: The agent failed to perform the verification step. The script requires the agent to confirm the identity of the caller, especially if the number is not registered. The agent should have asked, 'May I confirm, is this Mr. XYZ speaking?' or followed the non-registered number protocol.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not listen to the customer's query properly. The conversation was disjointed, and the agent repeatedly asked the customer to clarify their issue without fully understanding it. The agent should have said, 'Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you.'

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the customer's query. The script requires the agent to summarize the issue to ensure understanding, which was not done. The agent should have said, 'Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.'

5. **Providing a Solution**: Although the agent attempted to provide a solution, it was not clear or concise. The agent should have clearly stated the solution as per the script: 'Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].'

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The call ended without the agent asking if there was anything else they could assist with or thanking the customer for their time. The agent should have said, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!'

Overall, the agent did not adhere to the script, resulting in a score of 1 for complete non-adherence. The agent needs to follow the script closely to ensure a professional and effective customer service experience.",

  - They were concerned about discrepancies in the amount shown in their fund.
  - The customer was unsure about the deduction of brokerage fees from their profit.

- **Solutions provided by the agent**:
  - The agent explained that the brokerage fees were deducted at Rs. 20 per lot in Choice Finx.
  - The agent reassured the customer that the remaining amount after deducting brokerage fees would be received by them.
  - The agent informed the customer that the settlement would be completed by the next day, and they would receive a proper contract note with the final amount.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'I wanted to ask you something about the profit I made today. When the market was closed, my amount was Rs. 4,462. I have made a profit of Rs. 922 today. This fund is telling me that only Rs. 3922 is coming from the fund.', 'agent_solution': 'The agent explained that in Choice Finx, the brokerage is Rs. 20 per lot. Therefore, the brokerage amount will be deducted from the total profit, and the remaining amount will be received by the customer. The settlement will be completed by the next day, and the customer will receive a proper contract note with the amount.'}]}",0,"The agent did not provide a complete and professional greeting. The phrase used was simply 'Good afternoon. How may I assist you?' which lacks the introduction of the agent's name and the company they represent. A professional greeting should include the agent's name and the company to establish a clear and professional context for the call. This helps in building trust and clarity from the start of the interaction. 

To improve, the agent could use a more comprehensive greeting such as: 'Good afternoon, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would provide the customer with a clear understanding of who they are speaking with and the purpose of the call, enhancing the professionalism of the interaction.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:**
The agent interrupted the customer when they were trying to explain their concern about the profit calculation. The customer said, ""Ma'am, I wanted to ask you something about the profit I made today. Hello?"" and the agent responded with ""Yes, sir. Please go ahead and tell me about the issue you are facing."" This shows the agent did not acknowledge the customer's initial attempt to explain their concern.

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The agent did not acknowledge the customer's initial statement and instead prompted them to explain the issue again, which can be frustrating for the customer. This indicates that the agent was not fully attentive to the customer's initial attempt to communicate their concern.

**Suggested improvement:**
The agent could have said, ""I understand you have a question about the profit you made today. Could you please provide more details so I can assist you better?"" This would acknowledge the customer's concern and encourage them to provide more information without feeling ignored.",0,"The agent did not provide proper closure. The exact phrase used was: ""If you need any assistance or have any questions about Choice Finx, BTST, Choice Broking, early payin, Policy Inquiry, Ledger, care@choiceindia.com, SEBI, or Ambika, feel free to ask!"" This phrase does not effectively close the conversation as it does not thank the customer for their time or wish them well, nor does it ask if there is anything else the customer needs help with. Additionally, it does not inform the customer about the feedback request process, which is part of the closure guidelines. 

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates a lack of empathy towards the customer. The conversation is very transactional and technical, focusing solely on the details of the brokerage and settlement process without acknowledging the customer's feelings or concerns. 

Specific phrases that highlight the lack of empathy include:
- ""Okay. I have made a profit of Rs. 922 today. How much?"" - The agent's response is abrupt and does not acknowledge the customer's statement about their profit, which could be a point of pride or concern for the customer.
- ""Actually, you must have tried it in Choice Finx."" - This statement is factual but lacks any empathetic language that could reassure the customer.
- ""Yes, your total amount will be deducted from the total amount you will get from the brokerage, and the rest of the amount will be received by you."" - This is purely informational and does not address any potential confusion or frustration the customer might be feeling.

The agent could improve empathy by using phrases like, ""I understand this can be confusing,"" or ""I can see why you might be concerned about the deductions."" Additionally, the agent could have personalized the interaction by acknowledging the customer's feelings about their profit and providing reassurance about the process. This would help the customer feel heard and understood, rather than just receiving technical information.",3,"The agent maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation, which is a positive aspect. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy. For instance, the agent did not acknowledge the customer's concern or frustration directly, which is important in customer service interactions. Phrases like ""I understand your concern"" or ""Let me help you with that"" were missing, which could have helped in calming the customer and making them feel heard.

Additionally, the agent's explanation about the brokerage fees was somewhat unclear and could have been more concise and structured. Instead of saying, ""Actually, you must have tried it in Choice Finx. In Choice Finx, according to Rs. 20 per lot, your brokerage is going,"" the agent could have said, ""Let me explain how the brokerage fees work. In Choice Finx, there is a charge of Rs. 20 per lot, which is deducted from your profit.""

The agent also missed an opportunity to reassure the customer about the settlement process. Instead of just stating, ""You will have to wait until tomorrow,"" the agent could have added, ""Rest assured, the settlement will be completed by tomorrow, and you will receive a detailed contract note.""

Overall, while the agent was polite, they could have improved their communication by being more empathetic and clear in their explanations, which would have enhanced the customer's experience.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies a personalized greeting, including the agent's name and the company's name, which was not done. The agent simply said, ""Good afternoon. How may I assist you?"" instead of ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" This is a significant deviation.

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The customer mentioned a specific issue with the profit amount, but the agent did not summarize or reconfirm the query as per the script. The script requires the agent to say, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you."" This step was skipped.

3. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did provide a solution regarding the brokerage and settlement, which aligns with the script's requirement to provide a clear and concise solution. However, the explanation was not very clear and could have been more structured.

4. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script specifies that the agent should ask if there is anything else they can assist with and thank the customer for their time. This was not done, which is a significant deviation.

5. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: The agent did not mention the feedback request, which is part of the script for closure.

Overall, the agent showed limited adherence to the script, with significant deviations in greeting, listening, reconfirming the query, and closure. To improve, the agent should follow the script more closely, especially in greeting the customer, confirming the query, and providing a proper closure.",

- The customer is concerned about their account showing a negative balance after selling some items.
- They are seeking clarification on why the account is showing a minus balance and when it will be settled.
- The customer is also inquiring about the margin being utilized and the settlement time for the amount.

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- The agent explains that the negative balance is due to the margin being utilized in the day's order and assures the customer that the amount will be settled by the next day.
- The agent informs the customer that the settlement time is on Tuesdays and Mondays, and the profit from the sale will be settled the next day.
- They advise the customer to wait until the next day for the amount to be settled and reassure them that the position is cleared up after the sale.
- The agent explains that 80% of the sale amount is settled on the same day, with the remaining 20% settled the next day, and asks the customer to wait until the following morning for the settlement to be completed.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'I am selling, but the account is showing a minus.', 'agent_solution': ""The agent explained that the customer's margin is utilized by 0.79, and the amount from the sellout has not yet been settled.

The transcript starts with the customer speaking, and the agent's first response is not a greeting but rather a continuation of the conversation. The agent later says, 'Hello! How can I assist you today?' but this comes after the main discussion has already taken place, which is not an appropriate greeting at the start of a call. A proper greeting should have been given at the very beginning of the call to set a professional tone and establish clarity in the interaction. 

To improve, the agent should start the call with a clear and professional greeting, such as: 'Good afternoon, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would ensure the customer feels welcomed and knows who they are speaking with right from the start of the call.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** ""Suppose the name is accounted. What? Suppose the name is accounted. Is your name confirmed? Yes, yes. Okay, I will send you the receipt. Stay on the frequent line.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The agent did not address the customer's initial concern about the account showing a minus balance. Instead, they focused on confirming the customer's name and sending a receipt, which was not the customer's primary issue.

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""I understand that your account is showing a minus balance after selling. Let me check the details for you and explain why this might be happening."" This would have directly addressed the customer's concern and shown that the agent was listening to the issue at hand.",0,"The agent concluded the call with ""Hello! How can I assist you today?"" which is not a proper closure. This phrase is typically used to initiate a conversation rather than to conclude it. It does not provide any sense of finality or assurance to the customer that their issue has been addressed and the call is ending. Additionally, the agent did not ask if there was anything else the customer needed help with or thank the customer for their time, which are important elements of proper closure according to the guidelines provided. Furthermore, there was no mention of a feedback request, which is also part of the closure guidelines.

The agent could have improved the closure by saying, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services."" This would have provided a clear and courteous end to the conversation and encouraged customer feedback.",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrated a lack of empathy towards the customer. The conversation was heavily focused on technical details and procedural explanations without acknowledging the customer's frustration or confusion. The agent repeatedly stated the settlement times and the technical reasons for the account showing a negative balance, but did not use any empathetic language or attempt to understand the customer's feelings.

Problematic Phrases:
- The agent did not use any empathetic phrases such as ""I understand this can be frustrating"" or ""I can see why this is concerning for you."" Instead, the agent focused solely on explaining the technical process.
- The agent's responses were mechanical and repetitive, such as the repeated mention of settlement times without addressing the customer's emotional state or providing reassurance.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- The agent could have started by acknowledging the customer's concern with a phrase like, ""I understand how seeing a negative balance can be worrying, and I'm here to help clarify this for you.""
- Instead of just repeating the settlement times, the agent could have reassured the customer by saying, ""I know waiting can be difficult, but rest assured, your funds will be settled by tomorrow. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, I'm here to help.""
- Personalizing the interaction by using the customer's name and expressing understanding of their specific situation would have improved the empathy level significantly.",3,"The agent maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempted to explain the situation to the customer. However, there were several areas where the agent's communication could have been clearer and more empathetic. 

1. **Clarity and Structure**: The explanation about the settlement time was confusing and repetitive. The agent said, ""The settlement time is on Tuesdays and Mondays,"" and then repeated ""Monday"" multiple times, which could confuse the customer. A clearer statement like, ""Your funds will be settled by tomorrow, as settlements occur the next business day,"" would have been more effective.

2. **Empathy and Acknowledgment**: The agent did not acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion about the negative balance. Phrases like ""I understand this can be concerning"" or ""Let me clarify this for you"" would have helped in calming the customer.

3. **Professionalism**: The agent's response was somewhat mechanical and lacked a personal touch. Using the customer's name and ensuring they understood the explanation would have improved the interaction.

Overall, while the agent was polite, they missed opportunities to provide a more empathetic and clear response, which is why the score is a 3 for average control.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The transcript starts with ""Good afternoon, Jaisalmer. How are you?"" instead of the scripted ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" This is a significant deviation as the agent did not introduce themselves or the company properly.

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The transcript shows a lack of understanding and reconfirmation of the customer's issue. The agent should have allowed the customer to explain their concern fully and then reconfirmed the query as per the script: ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

3. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did provide a solution regarding the settlement time, but it was not communicated clearly and concisely. The explanation was repetitive and confusing, which deviates from the script's guidance to provide a clear and concise solution.

4. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The transcript ends abruptly without the agent asking if there is anything else they can assist with or thanking the customer for their time, as per the script: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

5. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: There was no mention of a feedback request, which is part of the script.

**Suggestions**:
- The agent should start with the proper greeting and introduction as per the script.
- Allow the customer to explain their issue fully and then reconfirm the query.
- Provide a clear and concise solution without unnecessary repetition.
- Ensure to close the call properly by asking if the customer needs further assistance and thanking them for their time.
- Mention the feedback request to the customer as per the script.",

The greeting does not introduce the agent or the company, nor does it offer assistance to the customer, which are key components of a professional greeting. 

To improve, the agent should use a more formal and structured greeting, such as: ""Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

I have already installed it.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The customer clearly stated that they have already uninstalled and reinstalled the application, yet the agent suggests doing it again without acknowledging that the customer has already taken this step. This indicates that the agent did not fully listen to or understand the customer's issue.

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""I understand you've already tried reinstalling the app. Let's try a different approach. Could you please send us a screenshot of the error message to care@choiceindia.com so we can investigate further?""",0,"The agent used the phrase ""Thank you so much for your time."" for closure. This closure is insufficient because it does not ask if the customer has any other questions or needs further assistance, nor does it inform the customer about providing feedback on the service. It leaves the interaction open-ended without ensuring the customer's issue is fully resolved or if they need anything else. Additionally, it does not follow the feedback request guidelines by informing the customer about a feedback survey after the call, which is important for service improvement and customer satisfaction tracking.

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services. Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrated a lack of empathy towards the customer. The conversation was very transactional and focused solely on the technical issue without acknowledging the customer's frustration or emotions. The agent repeated the customer's issue and provided instructions without any empathetic language or attempt to connect with the customer's experience.

Problematic Phrases:
- ""Okay, no issue."" - This phrase dismisses the customer's problem rather than acknowledging their frustration or inconvenience.
- ""Install the application again because there is no issue with us."" - This statement implies that the problem is solely on the customer's end, which can come across as dismissive and unhelpful.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- The agent could have said, ""I understand how frustrating it must be to keep reinstalling the app and still face the same issue. Let's see how we can resolve this for you."" This would show that the agent acknowledges the customer's frustration and is willing to help.
- Using phrases like ""I can see why this is frustrating"" or ""I understand this can be inconvenient"" would have demonstrated a higher level of empathy and understanding.",3,"The agent maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation, which is a positive aspect. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy. For instance, the agent did not acknowledge the customer's frustration or express understanding of the issue. A phrase like ""I understand this must be frustrating for you"" could have helped to calm the customer and show empathy. Additionally, the agent's responses were somewhat mechanical and lacked a personal touch, such as when they said, ""Install the application again because there is no issue with us."" This could be perceived as dismissive. Instead, the agent could have said, ""Let's try reinstalling the app together to see if that resolves the issue."" Overall, the agent was polite but missed opportunities to address the customer's frustration and provide a more supportive experience.",2,"The agent's adherence to the script was significantly lacking, with limited adherence to the script.

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent said, ""Good morning, guys. Can you follow me through?"" This is not a professional greeting and does not introduce the agent or the company. The agent should have used the script's greeting to maintain professionalism.

2. **Verification**: Although verification was not required in this call, the agent did attempt to confirm the identity by asking, ""Are you talking to Gaurav ji?"" This is a partial adherence to the script's intent of personalizing the interaction.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The customer mentioned an ""invalid token message,"" but the agent did not acknowledge or address this specific issue. Instead, the agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the query as per the script. The agent should have summarized the issue and confirmed it with the customer, such as, ""Just to confirm, you are facing an invalid token message when downloading the app. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent provided a solution by asking the customer to send a screenshot to the customer care email. However, the solution was not clearly explained, and the agent did not thank the customer for their patience as per the script.

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs help with and thanking them for their time. The agent simply repeated ""Thank you so much for your time,"" which lacks the script's suggested closure.

- Customer is confused about providing bank details, specifically the IFSC code and account number.
- Customer is concerned about the process of connecting to the bank and providing personal details.

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- Agent reassured the customer about technical difficulties and offered assistance with updating the address.
- Agent guided the customer through the process of skipping the memory addition step.
- Agent explained the importance of providing bank details, including the IFSC code and account number, for the transaction.
- Agent advised the customer to complete the process with the bank details of their primary bank and offered assistance if any issues arise.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'What is the address that you are updating in the document?', 'agent_solution': 'The agent suggested checking the TTO (Trade to Trade) details and mentioned that there might be technical difficulties.

The agent started the conversation with 'Good morning. How can I help you?' which is polite but lacks the necessary professionalism and detail expected in a business context. The agent did not introduce themselves or mention the company name, which is important for establishing trust and clarity in a professional setting. 

To improve, the agent could use a more comprehensive greeting such as: 'Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would provide the customer with a clear understanding of who they are speaking with and the context of the call, enhancing the professionalism of the interaction.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** The agent repeatedly interrupts and does not address the customer's main concern about the address and bank details. For example, the agent says, ""Uh, man. It seems like you might be experiencing some technical difficulties. How can I assist you today?"" and later, ""Hello! How can I assist you today?"" without acknowledging the specific issue the customer is facing.

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The agent fails to acknowledge or summarize the customer's query about the address and bank details, which is the main concern. Instead, the agent provides irrelevant information and instructions without confirming the customer's actual issue.

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you are asking for the address and bank details to update in the document. Let me check that for you."" This would show that the agent is actively listening and addressing the customer's specific concern.",0,"The agent did not provide proper closure. The exact phrase used was: ""If there is any issue, you can call back on the same number."" This closure is insufficient because it does not confirm if the customer has any other questions or needs further assistance, nor does it thank the customer for their time or provide a feedback request. It leaves the conversation open-ended without a clear conclusion or appreciation for the customer's interaction with the service. 

Suggestion: The agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates a lack of empathy towards the customer. Throughout the conversation, the agent focuses solely on technical details and instructions without acknowledging the customer's emotions or frustrations. For example, the agent repeatedly asks technical questions and provides instructions without any empathetic language or acknowledgment of the customer's potential confusion or frustration. Phrases like ""Please check your TTO details"" and ""You must have an account number"" are purely technical and do not address the customer's emotional state.

The agent also misses several opportunities to express understanding or empathy. For instance, when the customer seems confused or frustrated, the agent could have said, ""I understand this process can be confusing, let me help guide you through it,"" or ""I can see why this might be frustrating, let's take it step by step.""

Overall, the agent's approach is mechanical and lacks any personal touch or empathetic engagement, which is why the empathy score is rated as 1.",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates a lack of clear communication and professionalism, which affects their ability to maintain control of the conversation. The dialogue is disjointed and lacks coherence, making it difficult for the customer to follow the instructions. The agent's responses are repetitive and do not directly address the customer's concerns, which could lead to frustration.

For example, the agent repeatedly says, ""I'm processing it again,"" without providing any clear explanation or reassurance to the customer. This could be improved by saying, ""I understand this process can be confusing. Let me walk you through the steps to ensure everything is correct.""

Additionally, the agent's tone seems rushed and dismissive at times, as seen in phrases like ""You must have an account number"" and ""You have to fill in the bank details."" A more empathetic approach would be to say, ""I understand this might be a bit overwhelming. Let's take it step by step to make sure we have all the necessary information.""

Overall, the agent needs to improve their communication skills by being more patient, providing clearer instructions, and acknowledging the customer's potential frustration to enhance the overall customer experience.",1,"The agent's adherence to the script was extremely poor, warranting a score of 1. Here are the justifications and explanations for each deduction:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies a structured greeting, including the agent's name and the company name, which was not followed. Instead, the agent simply said, ""Good morning. How can I help you?"" The agent should have said, ""Good Morning, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not listen to the customer's query properly. The script instructs the agent to allow the client to express their concerns fully without interruption. However, the transcript shows a lack of clear understanding and engagement with the customer's issue. The agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you.""

3. **Reconfirming the Query**: There was no attempt to reconfirm the customer's query. The script requires the agent to summarize the customer's issue to ensure understanding, which was not done. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

4. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent attempted to provide a solution, it was not clear or structured as per the script. The script requires a clear and concise solution, which was not evident in the transcript. The agent should have provided a structured response based on the customer's query.

5. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure to the call. The script specifies a closing statement to ensure the customer feels the interaction is complete. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent failed to follow the script in almost all aspects, leading to a score of 1 for complete non-adherence.",

- **Queries by the Customer:**
  - The customer inquired about a number, specifically mentioning ""1,942"" and expressed a desire to transfer it to their account.
  - The customer confirmed their intention to complete the transfer when asked by the agent.

- **Solutions provided by the Agent:**
  - The agent acknowledged the customer's request to transfer the number and proceeded to initiate the transfer process.
  - The agent confirmed with the customer if they wanted to complete the transfer, to which the customer responded affirmatively.
  - The agent assured the customer by saying, ""Yes, ma'am. You're welcome,"" indicating that the transfer process was successfully completed.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'Do you want to complete it?', 'agent_solution': ""The agent confirms the completion of the transaction by transferring the amount to the customer's account.""}]}",0,"The agent did not provide a proper greeting to the customer. The transcript begins with 'Good morning to all students of the department,' which is not a direct or professional greeting to the customer. There is no introduction of the agent or the company, nor is there an offer of assistance. This does not meet the standard for a polite and professional greeting as outlined in the reference greetings.

To improve, the agent should start the conversation with a clear and professional greeting, such as: 'Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you?' This would ensure the customer feels acknowledged and knows who they are speaking with, setting a positive tone for the interaction.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** The agent did not acknowledge or respond to any specific query from the customer. The conversation lacks any clear indication of the customer's concern or question being addressed. The agent's responses are abrupt and do not show any understanding or confirmation of the customer's needs.

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The agent did not engage in any meaningful dialogue with the customer. There is no evidence of the agent asking for clarification, summarizing the customer's issue, or providing a solution. The interaction seems mechanical and lacks any personalized attention to the customer's needs.

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you."" This would invite the customer to share their issue and allow the agent to respond appropriately.",0,"The agent concluded the call with ""Yes, ma'am. You're welcome."" This phrase does not follow the closure guidelines as it does not ask if there is anything else the customer needs assistance with, nor does it thank the customer for their time or wish them a good day. Additionally, there is no mention of a feedback request, which is part of the closure guidelines.

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""",1,"The transcript provided is very brief and lacks any indication of empathy from the agent. The interaction is purely transactional, with the agent focusing solely on completing the task at hand without acknowledging the customer's emotions or providing any form of empathetic communication. 

Specific phrases that highlight the lack of empathy include:
- ""What's your number?"" and ""I'll transfer it to your account."" These statements are direct and lack any form of personalization or acknowledgment of the customer's situation or feelings.
- ""Do you want to complete it?"" and ""Okay, one minute."" Again, these are purely transactional and do not engage with the customer on an emotional level.

To improve empathy, the agent could have said something like:
- ""Good morning! How can I assist you today? I understand you might be in a hurry, so I'll do my best to help you quickly.""
- ""I see you're looking to complete a transaction. Let me make sure everything goes smoothly for you.""

These suggestions would help the agent to acknowledge the customer's needs and emotions, making the interaction more personable and empathetic.",3,"The agent in the transcript maintains a polite tone throughout the interaction, which is a positive aspect. However, the conversation lacks elements of empathy and customer engagement that are crucial for a higher score. The agent does not use any phrases that acknowledge the customer's needs or concerns, such as ""I understand your concern"" or ""Let me help you,"" which are important for demonstrating excellent control.

Additionally, the conversation is very transactional and lacks warmth or personalization. The agent could have improved by saying something like, ""Thank you for your patience,"" or ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"" to make the interaction more engaging and customer-focused.

Overall, while the agent is polite, the interaction feels rushed and lacks the elements that would elevate it to a higher level of professionalism and customer care.",1,"The agent did not adhere to the script at all during the call. Here are the specific deviations and what the agent could have done instead:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not greet the customer according to the script. Instead of saying ""Good morning to all students of the department,"" the agent should have said, ""Good Morning, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" This would have set a professional tone and aligned with the script.

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not listen to the customer's query or allow them to express their concerns. The script requires the agent to say, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you."" This step was completely skipped.

3. **Reconfirming the Query**: There was no attempt to reconfirm the customer's query. The agent should have summarized the customer's issue and confirmed it back to them, as per the script: ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

4. **Providing a Solution**: Although the agent mentioned transferring an amount, it was not done in a structured manner as per the script. The agent should have provided a clear and concise solution based on the customer's query.

5. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure to the call. The script suggests saying, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!"" This was not done, leaving the call without a professional ending.

Overall, the agent's performance did not align with any part of the script, resulting in a score of 1 for complete non-adherence.",

- The customer, Mr. Akil, called to inquire about the status of an IPO application that had been amended but not updated.
- He provided his client code and registered mobile number for the agent to check the status.
- Mr. Akil was concerned about the delay in the update of his IPO application and wanted to know when it would be reflected.

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- Deeksha checked the status of the IPO application using the client code and registered mobile number provided by Mr. Akil.
- The agent informed Mr. Akil that the IPO application was already in the UPAE status and that the update would occur once confirmation was received from the central depository.
- Deeksha reassured Mr. Akil that his amount was blocked, indicating a successful transaction, and advised him to wait for the update to reflect in the application.
- The agent explained that the confirmation would come from the exchange and assured Mr. Akil that once received, the application would be updated accordingly.
- Deeksha provided assurance to Mr. Akil that his IPO application for Jungle Campus would also be successful, considering the amount was already blocked.
- The agent concluded the call by thanking Mr. Akil and requesting feedback, ensuring him that the application update would occur once confirmation was received from the exchange.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'I have just applied for an IPO.

The greeting used was ""Mr. Akil, this is Deeksha. How can I assist you?"" While the agent did introduce herself, she did not provide the company name or a formal greeting such as 'Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening'. This makes the greeting less professional and potentially confusing for the customer, who may not immediately recognize the context of the call. 

To improve, the agent could use a more structured and professional greeting, such as: ""Good Morning, this is Deeksha calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" This would provide clarity and set a professional tone for the conversation.",0,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:**
The agent repeatedly asked for the client's information without acknowledging the customer's repeated statement: ""Ma'am, I just applied for an IPO. It's been amended but not updated yet.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The customer clearly stated their issue twice, but the agent did not acknowledge or address this specific concern before asking for the client's information again. This indicates a lack of active listening and understanding of the customer's immediate concern.

**Suggested improvement:**
The agent could have said, ""I understand that you have applied for an IPO and it's been amended but not updated yet. Let me first verify your details so I can check the status for you."" This would acknowledge the customer's concern while still proceeding with the necessary verification process.",0,"The agent's closure was: ""Thank you so much, sir. Have a very good day. Please call me. I will share my feedback rating. Thanks for calling me."" This closure is insufficient because it does not include a clear offer for further assistance (e.g., ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"") and the feedback request is not properly structured according to the guidelines. The agent's statement ""Please call me; I'll share my feedback rating"" is confusing and does not clearly inform the customer about the feedback process or its importance. Additionally, the agent did not mention that the customer would receive a message to rate the service, which is part of the feedback request guidelines. 

Suggestion: The agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""",1,"The agent, Deeksha, demonstrated minimal to no empathy throughout the interaction with the customer, Mr. Akil. The conversation was heavily focused on technical details and procedural steps without any acknowledgment of the customer's emotions or concerns. 

Specific phrases where empathy was lacking include:
- ""Okay, I will check your status now."" This is a straightforward response that does not acknowledge the customer's frustration or concern about the delay in the IPO update.
- ""Sir, until we get the confirmation from CDA's side, the same thing is not updated in the application. So, you wait for a while."" This response is purely informational and does not address any potential anxiety or frustration the customer might be feeling about the delay.

Problematic aspects:
- The agent did not use any empathetic language or phrases that would indicate understanding or concern for the customer's situation.
- The agent missed opportunities to reassure the customer or express understanding of their frustration.

To improve empathy, the agent could have said:
- ""I understand how important this update is for you, and I can see why the delay would be concerning. Let me check the status for you right away.""
- ""I can imagine this situation is frustrating, especially since your amount is already blocked. Rest assured, I'll do my best to provide you with the latest information.""

By incorporating empathetic language and acknowledging the customer's feelings, the agent could have significantly improved the quality of the interaction.",3,"The agent, Deeksha, maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempted to address the customer's issue. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy.

1. **Repetition and Clarity**: The agent repeated the request for the client's code and registered number without acknowledging the customer's repeated statement about the IPO amendment. This could have been handled better by saying, ""I understand you've applied for an IPO and it's been amended but not updated. Let me check the status for you. Could you please provide your client code and registered mobile number?""

2. **Acknowledging Customer's Concern**: The agent did not directly acknowledge the customer's concern about the IPO status not being updated. A more empathetic response would have been, ""I understand this can be frustrating. Let me see what I can find out for you.""

3. **Communication of Process**: The explanation about the confirmation process from the exchange could have been clearer. Instead of saying, ""Sir, until we get the confirmation from CDA's side, the same thing is not updated in the application,"" a clearer explanation would be, ""The update will occur once we receive confirmation from the central depository. This process can take some time, but rest assured, your amount is blocked, and there should be no issues.""

Overall, while the agent was polite, there were missed opportunities to show empathy and provide clearer communication, which would have enhanced the customer's experience.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent said, ""Mr. Akil, this is Deeksha. How can I assist you?"" The agent should have used the full greeting as per the script.

2. **Verification**: The agent did not follow the verification process as outlined in the script. The script requires the agent to confirm the identity of the caller by asking for specific details if the number is not registered. The agent asked for the client code and registered mobile number, which is not in line with the script's verification process.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not allow the customer to fully express their concern before responding. The script advises the agent to let the client finish speaking without interruption.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the query as per the script. The script suggests summarizing the query to ensure understanding, which was not done.

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent provided a solution, but it was not clear and concise as per the script's guidance. The explanation about the confirmation from the exchange could have been clearer.

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs help with and thanking them for their time, which was not done.

7. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: The agent did not mention the feedback request as per the script.

**Suggestions**:
- For greeting, the agent should have said, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is Deeksha calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""
- For verification, the agent should have followed the script's process for non-registered numbers.
- The agent should have allowed the customer to fully express their concern before responding.
- The agent should have reconfirmed the query by summarizing it.
- The agent should have provided a clearer solution and explained the process more effectively.
- For closure, the agent should have asked if there was anything else the customer needed and thanked them for their time.
- The agent should have mentioned the feedback request as per the script.",

The greeting used was 'Good morning, how are you? Manish here. How may I assist you?' This greeting is courteous and aligns well with the reference greetings provided. It includes a time-appropriate salutation, introduces the agent by name, and offers assistance, which is both professional and helpful. To improve, the agent could include the company name in the greeting to provide more context to the customer, such as 'Good morning, this is Manish from Choice Finx. How may I assist you?' This would ensure the customer immediately knows who they are speaking with and the context of the call, enhancing the professionalism of the interaction.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:**
The agent repeatedly misunderstood the customer's initial query about the amount in question. The customer clearly stated, ""I mean, 90,000 was shown in Ledger. That balance is not shown here. Can you check it?"" The agent responded with, ""19,000, sir, or 90,000?"" and continued to confirm ""19,000"" despite the customer clarifying ""90,000.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The agent failed to accurately capture the customer's concern about the discrepancy in the ledger balance, which was initially stated as 90,000. This led to confusion and a lack of clarity in addressing the customer's actual issue.

**Suggested improvement:**
The agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you mentioned that 90,000 was shown in your ledger, but it is not appearing now. Let me check that for you."" This would have acknowledged the customer's concern correctly and set the stage for a more accurate resolution.",0,"The agent used the phrase 'Any other help? Okay, thank you. Thank you for calling, sir. Have a nice day.' for closure. This closure is insufficient because it does not include a feedback request, which is part of the closure guidelines. Additionally, the phrase 'Any other help?' is less formal and could be improved to better align with the guidelines provided, such as 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today?' to ensure clarity and professionalism. Furthermore, the agent did not inform the customer about the feedback request, which is an important part of the closure process to gather customer satisfaction data and improve services. 

Suggestion: The agent could have said, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.' This would provide a more complete and professional closure.",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrated a lack of empathy towards the customer. Throughout the conversation, the agent focused solely on providing technical details and did not acknowledge the customer's concerns or emotions. For instance, when the customer expressed confusion and concern about the missing funds, the agent did not use any empathetic language such as ""I understand how concerning this must be for you"" or ""I can see why this situation is frustrating."" Instead, the agent repeatedly provided factual information without addressing the customer's emotional state.

Additionally, the agent missed several opportunities to reassure the customer or express understanding. For example, when the customer realized they had incurred a loss, the agent could have said, ""I'm sorry to hear about the unexpected loss. Let's see how we can resolve this for you."" Instead, the agent simply confirmed the loss without any empathetic acknowledgment.

To improve empathy, the agent could have personalized their responses by acknowledging the customer's feelings and offering reassurance. Using phrases like ""I understand this is frustrating, and I'm here to help you sort it out"" would have made the customer feel more understood and supported.",4,"The agent maintained good control throughout the conversation, staying polite and focused on resolving the customer's issue. They repeated the customer's concerns to ensure understanding and provided clear information about the account balance and withdrawal process. However, there were a few missed opportunities to directly address the customer's potential frustration or confusion. For example, when the customer was confused about the loss amount, the agent could have said, ""I understand this can be confusing, let me clarify the details for you,"" to show empathy and help calm the situation. Additionally, the agent could have used more empathetic language when explaining the loss, such as ""I understand this is unexpected, and I'm here to help you understand what happened."" Overall, the agent was professional and effective, but incorporating more empathetic language could have enhanced the interaction.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies a structured greeting, including the agent's name and company, which was not followed. Instead, the agent said, ""Good morning, how are you? Manish here. How may I assist you?"" The agent should have said, ""Good Morning, this is Manish calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not listen to the query properly. The customer had to repeat the query multiple times, and there was confusion about the amounts involved. The script advises allowing the client to finish speaking without interruption, which was not adhered to. The agent should have listened carefully and then reconfirmed the query accurately.

3. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did attempt to reconfirm the query, but it was done after multiple clarifications from the customer. The script suggests summarizing the query clearly, which was not effectively done initially. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: Your account had 19,000 rupees, but it is not showing in your account, correct?""

4. **Providing a Solution**: The agent provided a solution but did not follow the script's structure. The explanation was somewhat confusing and not as clear and concise as the script suggests. The agent should have clearly stated the solution in a structured manner as per the script.

5. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure as per the script. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs help with and thanking them for their time. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, with limited adherence to the structured process outlined in the script. The agent needs to follow the script more closely to ensure a consistent and professional customer service experience.",

  - The customer is concerned about the fund balance in their Choice BTST account.
  - They recently had a sale of around 200K rupees, but the amount is not reflecting in their trading account.
  - The customer wants to know when the sale amount will be reflected in their account and how they can withdraw it.

- **Solutions provided by the agent**:
  - The agent informs the customer that the sale amount will reflect in their account on the next working day, which would be Monday.
  - The customer can withdraw the amount around 10:00 to 10:30 AM.
  - If the customer places a withdrawal request before market hours, the amount will be credited to their Demat account on the same day. If it's after market hours, it will be credited on the next working day.
  - The agent advises the customer to ensure they apply for withdrawal before or during market hours to have the amount reflected on the same day.
  - The customer confirms understanding and is informed that after March 8th, the process will change.
  - The customer expresses gratitude and indicates no further queries, concluding the call.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'I just had a sale for rupees near about 200K today, and it is not reflecting in my trading account.

The conversation started directly with the customer's concern about their fund balances. A proper greeting was missing, which is essential for setting a professional tone and establishing rapport with the customer. The agent should have started the call with a polite and professional greeting, such as introducing themselves and asking how they can assist the customer. This would have made the interaction more welcoming and professional. For future interactions, the agent should use a greeting like, 'Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' to ensure a positive start to the conversation.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:**

""Am I speaking with Aniket, right? Yes, Aniket. Aniket, you are inquiring about which amount, sir? Yes, I need to get... Pankaj ji, you are talking about which amount, sir?""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The agent asked the customer twice about which amount they were inquiring, even after the customer had clearly stated they had a sale for 'rupees near about 200K today' and wanted to know when it would reflect in their account. This repetition indicates the agent did not listen to or acknowledge the customer's initial explanation.

**Suggested improvement:**
The agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you mentioned a sale of approximately 200K today, and you want to know when it will reflect in your account and when you can withdraw it. Let me check that for you."" This would show the agent listened and understood the customer's query before proceeding to provide a solution.",0,"The agent used the phrase ""Any other further information, sir, other than this?"" for closure. This phrase does not align with the closure guidelines provided, which suggest asking if there is anything else the agent can assist with and thanking the customer for their time. Additionally, the agent did not mention anything about a feedback request, which is part of the closure guidelines. The closure was insufficient because it did not properly conclude the conversation with a polite and clear ending, nor did it encourage the customer to provide feedback on the service received, which is important for service improvement and customer satisfaction assessment. 

Suggestion: The agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates minimal empathy towards the customer. The agent's responses are primarily focused on providing technical information without acknowledging the customer's concerns or emotions. For example, when the customer expresses concern about their fund balances not reflecting, the agent immediately jumps to checking details and providing factual information without any empathetic acknowledgment of the customer's worry.

Problematic Phrases:
- ""Please stay online. I am checking your details."" - This is a procedural response and lacks any empathetic language.
- ""Yeah, the sale amount will reflect in your account on the next working day."" - This is a straightforward answer without any acknowledgment of the customer's concern.

The agent could have improved empathy by using phrases like:
- ""I understand how important it is for you to see your funds reflected promptly. Let me check the details for you.""
- ""I can see why this might be concerning. Rest assured, I'm here to help you with this.""

By incorporating such empathetic language, the agent would have shown a better understanding of the customer's emotional state, thereby improving the overall customer experience.",3,"The agent maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation and provided the necessary information to the customer. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy.

1. **Missed Opportunities for Empathy**: The agent did not acknowledge the customer's concern or frustration at the beginning of the call. A phrase like ""I understand your concern about the fund balance not reflecting, and I'm here to help you with that"" would have been more empathetic.

2. **Clarity and Reassurance**: The agent's responses were somewhat mechanical and lacked reassurance. For example, when explaining the process, the agent could have said, ""Rest assured, your funds will be available for withdrawal on the next working day, and I'll guide you through the process to ensure it's smooth.""

3. **Repetition and Confusion**: The agent repeated the question about the amount unnecessarily, which could confuse the customer. Instead, they should have confirmed the details once and proceeded with the solution.

Overall, while the agent was polite, they could have improved by acknowledging the customer's concerns more directly and providing clearer, more reassuring guidance. This would have enhanced the customer's experience and demonstrated better control over the situation.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not greet the customer as per the script. The script requires the agent to introduce themselves and the company, and possibly address the client by name. The agent did not do this. Instead, the agent could have started with, ""Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. Am I speaking with Mr. Aniket?""

2. **Verification**: Although verification was not required, the agent did attempt to confirm the customer's identity by asking, ""Am I speaking with Aniket, right?"" This is a minor deviation as it was not necessary for this call.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not listen to the query properly. The customer had to repeat their concern about the fund balance not reflecting. The agent should have allowed the customer to fully express their concern before responding. The script suggests saying, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not effectively reconfirm the query. The script suggests summarizing the query to ensure understanding, which the agent did not do. The agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you are concerned about the 200K sale not reflecting in your account, correct?""

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent provided a solution regarding when the funds would reflect and be available for withdrawal. This part was handled well.

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs and thanking them for their time. The agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, particularly in greeting, listening, reconfirming the query, and closure, which justifies a score of 2.",

I did it this morning and the day before yesterday, ma'am. I did it for Rs. 500. See, I did it. I did it yesterday as well. It is pending in the payout. What time did it take? 12 o'clock. It was at 12 o'clock, sir. This is today's, ma'am. Yes, today's. It was at 9,000, ma'am. Yes, 9,000, yes. When will that come, ma'am? Sir, this is today's 12th pending, right? So, pending is given to modify all this. So, I think it is given to modify till 4 o'clock. After 4 o'clock, I think it will come till 9 o'clock, sir. It will come by 9 in the evening. By 9 in the evening. Yes, by 9 in the evening. Did you get it earlier as well? Yes, if you look at the earlier one, it was Rs. 500 yesterday. Why did you not get that? Yesterday's Rs. 500. Success. Rs. 500 has been a success, sir. But madam, I can't see the entry, madam. I can't see the entry, madam. Sir, I can see Rs. 500 success. Let me check. Success. It's a success, sir. But, ma'am, I can't see the entry, ma'am. Sir, I can see 500 subscribers. Let me check your account. You have withdrawn Rs. 9,500 from your account. But ma'am, I didn't see it in my account. You had deposited Rs. 5,000 on 27th November. You had Rs. 10,000. You withdrew Rs. 500 on 28th November. So, you are showing Rs. 9,500. Yes. So, you have withdrawn Rs. 500. Okay, but I can't see it, ma'am. You can see it. Will 9000 come tonight, ma'am? Yes, you can see it once in Kotak Mahindra. If it hasn't come, then send a screenshot of your statement to customercare@choiceindia.com because the entry here is showing you that 5000 has been paid out. Thank you very much. Can I write something in the subject? Yes, you can write. I had put a payout on the 28th. So here it is written in the Choice, 500. But I did not get credit in the account. Oh. You are checking in Kotak only, right? Yes, in Kotak. Check it once, sir. Okay? In the statement, yes. Because the process has been done here. Okay, we'll see. Okay? Yes. And don't modify anything in the pending; otherwise, it will take a lot of time. It will be successful by 9 p.m. today. It will be successful after 4 p.m. After that, it will be successful by 9 p.m. Should I modify anything in the pending? No, no, don't do anything. Okay? Okay.","**Queries by the customer:**
- The customer is inquiring about a withdrawal of Rs. 500 that has not been received yet.
- The customer is concerned about the timing of the withdrawal and when the money will be credited.
- The customer is also questioning why a previous withdrawal of Rs. 500 is not reflecting in the account.

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- The agent checks and informs the customer that the pending withdrawal of Rs. 9,000 will be processed by 9 p.m. that day.
- The agent confirms that the previous withdrawal of Rs. 500 was successful, even though the customer couldn't see the entry in the account.
- The agent advises the customer to check their account statement in Kotak Mahindra and send a screenshot to customer care if needed.
- The agent instructs the customer not to modify anything in the pending transactions to ensure successful processing by 9 p.m.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': ""I had withdrawn money.

The transaction should be successful by 9 PM.'}]}",1,"The agent greeted the customer in a polite and professional manner. The greeting used was: 'Good afternoon, sir. This is Sharma from Choice Clinics. How can I help you, sir?' This greeting is courteous and follows the professional standard by introducing the agent's name and the company, and offering assistance. To improve, the agent could ensure consistency in addressing the customer by using either 'sir' or 'ma'am' throughout the conversation, as there was a mix of both in the transcript. Additionally, the agent could confirm the customer's name earlier in the conversation to personalize the interaction further.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:**
The agent repeatedly confirms that the Rs. 500 transaction was successful, saying ""Sir, I can see Rs. 500 success. Let me check. Success. It's a success, sir."" However, the customer clearly states, ""But madam, I can't see the entry, madam. I can't see the entry, madam.""

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The agent fails to acknowledge the customer's concern that they cannot see the Rs. 500 entry in their account, despite the agent's system showing it as successful. The agent should have addressed the discrepancy between the customer's account view and the system's status.

**Suggested improvement:**
The agent could have said, ""I understand that you are unable to see the Rs. 500 entry in your account. Let me guide you on how to check your account statement or assist you further to resolve this issue."" This would show that the agent acknowledges the customer's concern and is willing to help resolve the discrepancy.",0,"The agent did not provide proper closure. The conversation ended with the agent saying, ""Okay? Okay."" This does not follow the closure guidelines of asking if there is anything else the customer needs assistance with or thanking the customer for their time. Additionally, there was no mention of a feedback request, which is part of the closure guidelines. 

The closure was insufficient because it did not ensure the customer felt their issue was fully addressed or that they were valued. It also missed an opportunity to gather feedback, which is crucial for service improvement.

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates minimal empathy towards the customer. Throughout the conversation, the agent focuses primarily on the technical details of the transaction and does not acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion about the missing funds. For example, the agent repeatedly states, ""Sir, I can see Rs. 500 success,"" without addressing the customer's concern that they cannot see the entry in their account. This response lacks empathetic language and does not reassure the customer.

The agent could have improved their empathy by using phrases like, ""I understand how concerning it must be not to see the funds in your account,"" or ""I can see why this situation is frustrating for you."" These statements would acknowledge the customer's emotions and show that the agent is not just focused on the technical aspects of the issue.

Additionally, the agent could have personalized their responses by asking more questions about the customer's experience or offering to follow up to ensure the issue is resolved, which would demonstrate a deeper level of care and understanding.",3,"The agent maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation, which is commendable. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy. 

1. **Acknowledging the Customer's Frustration**: The agent did not acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion about the missing funds. A simple phrase like ""I understand this is concerning for you, and I'm here to help"" could have made the customer feel more understood and reassured.

2. **Clarity and Patience**: The agent's responses were somewhat repetitive and lacked clarity. For instance, when the customer repeatedly mentioned not seeing the entry, the agent could have said, ""I understand you're not seeing the entry. Let me double-check the details for you and guide you on the next steps."" This would have shown more patience and a willingness to assist.

3. **Guidance on Next Steps**: While the agent did provide instructions on what to do if the funds were not visible, the explanation was a bit rushed and could have been clearer. Instead of saying ""send a screenshot of your statement to customercare@choiceindia.com,"" the agent could have added, ""Please send a screenshot of your bank statement to our customer care email, and we'll investigate this further for you.""

Overall, the agent was polite but missed opportunities to show empathy and provide clearer guidance, which is why the score is a 3 for average control.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent said, ""Good afternoon, sir. This is Sharma from Choice Clinics. How can I help you, sir?"" This is a deviation as the company name was incorrect, and the script was not followed verbatim. The agent should have used the correct company name and followed the script.

2. **Verification**: Although verification was not required in this call, the agent did ask, ""Is Mr. Vilas speaking?"" which aligns with the script's intent for registered number calls. No deduction here.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The customer mentioned withdrawing money on two occasions, but the agent seemed to repeat questions and not fully acknowledge the customer's statements. The script advises allowing the client to finish speaking without interruption, which was not adhered to.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the query as per the script. The script suggests summarizing the query to ensure understanding, which was not done. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did provide a solution, but it was not clear and concise as per the script. The agent should have clearly stated the solution and the steps the customer needed to take.

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs help with and thanking them for their time. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, with limited adherence to the key parts, resulting in a score of 2.",

- The customer wanted to know about their bank account details.
- Specifically, the customer inquired about the funds in their bank account in Gulbrow, Pune.
- The customer also wanted to confirm if the funds had been withdrawn and requested information on the bank details.

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- The agent confirmed that the customer's request for withdrawal had been successfully placed.
- The agent assured the customer that the payment would be transferred to their bank by the evening.
- The agent identified the primary bank as Bank of India and clarified that since the customer had selected SEBI for withdrawal, the funds would be transferred to the SEBI account.
- The agent reassured the customer that they would receive the funds in the SEBI account since that was the selected option during withdrawal.
- The agent provided confirmation and clarification to the customer's queries, ensuring that the customer understood the process and the expected outcome.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'I want to know the bank details and whether the funds have been withdrawn or not.', 'agent_solution': 'The agent confirmed that the request for withdrawal has been successfully placed and requested the customer to wait until the evening for the payment to be transferred to their bank.

The agent started the conversation with 'I am Aman from Choice Broking. Can you tell me about your bank account?' This greeting is abrupt and does not include a polite salutation or an offer of assistance. It also does not clearly identify the purpose of the call or how the agent can assist the customer. 

To improve, the agent could use a more structured and courteous greeting such as: 'Good Morning/Afternoon, this is Aman from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would set a more professional tone for the conversation and make the customer feel more welcomed and valued.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** ""Sir, what do you want to know about the bank? Which bank? Please tell me. Do you want to know the bank details?"" 

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The customer had already mentioned they wanted to know whether the funds had been withdrawn or not. The agent repeatedly asked about the bank details without addressing the customer's main concern about the withdrawal status.

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you want to know if the funds have been withdrawn from your account. Let me check that for you."" This would have acknowledged the customer's query and provided a clear path to resolving their concern.",0,"The agent used the phrase ""Thank you for calling Choice Finx"" for closure. This closure is insufficient because it does not include an offer for further assistance or a request for feedback, which are important elements of a proper closure according to the guidelines provided. The agent should have asked if there was anything else the customer needed help with and informed the customer about the feedback request process to ensure a complete and satisfactory closure to the call. This would help in ensuring the customer feels fully supported and valued, and it would also provide the company with valuable feedback for service improvement. 

Suggested improvement: The agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services. Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""",1,"The agent in this transcript demonstrated a lack of empathy throughout the interaction. The conversation was heavily focused on technical details and procedural aspects without acknowledging the customer's emotions or concerns. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Lack of Empathetic Language**: The agent did not use any empathetic phrases such as ""I understand your concern"" or ""I can see why this might be worrying for you."" Instead, the agent's responses were purely transactional and focused on the technical aspects of the issue.

2. **Missed Opportunities for Empathy**: When the customer expressed concern about whether the funds had been withdrawn, the agent could have acknowledged the customer's anxiety by saying something like, ""I understand that waiting for a transaction can be stressful. Let me help clarify this for you."" Instead, the agent simply stated procedural information without addressing the customer's feelings.

3. **Impersonal Interaction**: The agent did not personalize the interaction or show any understanding of the customer's situation. The conversation was mechanical, with the agent asking for information and providing answers without any personal touch.

To improve empathy, the agent could:
- Use empathetic language to acknowledge the customer's feelings.
- Personalize responses to show understanding of the customer's specific situation.
- Proactively reassure the customer about the process and timelines, showing that they care about the customer's peace of mind.",3,"The agent, Aman, maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation, which is a positive aspect. However, there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy. 

1. **Lack of Empathy and Acknowledgment:** The agent did not use empathetic phrases such as ""I understand your concern"" or ""Let me help you with that,"" which could have helped in calming the customer and making them feel heard. Instead, the agent jumped directly into asking questions about the bank details without acknowledging the customer's concerns.

2. **Clarity and Structure:** The conversation lacked structure, with the agent asking repetitive questions like ""Which bank?"" and ""Do you want to know the bank details?"" This could have been streamlined by first confirming the customer's request and then proceeding with the necessary steps. For example, ""I understand you want to check the status of your withdrawal. Let me confirm the details for you.""

3. **Missed Opportunities for Reassurance:** The agent could have reassured the customer by explaining the process more clearly, such as ""Once the withdrawal is processed, it will reflect in your SEBI account by this evening. If you have any issues, feel free to contact us again.""

Overall, while the agent was polite, they missed opportunities to show empathy and provide a structured, reassuring response, which is why the score is a 3 for average control.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. Instead of introducing themselves as ""ABC from Choice Finx,"" the agent said, ""I am Aman from Choice Broking."" This is a deviation from the script which specifies a formal greeting and the correct company name.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is Aman calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification**: The script requires verification if the call is from a non-registered number, but this step was not applicable in this call. No deduction here.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The conversation was disjointed, and the agent did not allow the customer to fully express their concern before responding.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the customer's query as per the script. Instead, the conversation moved directly to providing a solution without summarizing the issue.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent provided a solution regarding the withdrawal request, which aligns with the script's requirement to provide a clear and concise solution.

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure as per the script. The script requires asking if there is anything else the customer needs and thanking them for their time.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, particularly in greeting, listening, reconfirming the query, and closure, leading to a score of 2 for limited adherence to the script. The agent needs to follow the script more closely to ensure a consistent and professional customer experience.",

Even after Saturday, I spoke to you at 9:30 in the morning. Yes, yes, I spoke to you. Give it to Lokesh. I'll talk to him. No, sir, we can't transfer him from here. Lokesh sits in Bhopal. Oh, he sits there? Yes, he sits there. Does he get a Choice Finx transfer? No, sir, I'll ask him to call you. Okay, ask him to call me. Yes, I'll call you.","**Queries by the customer:**
- Nirman Sarab called regarding two payouts discussed on Saturday.
- He inquired about the status of the payouts and mentioned a payout request for ₹90,000.
- Nirman Sarab expressed confusion about the process of completing the payouts, particularly through the app.
- He wanted confirmation that both accounts would be processed before 2 o'clock.

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- Chhaya confirmed the discussion about the payouts and mentioned that a request for ₹90,000 had been sent.
- The agent reassured Nirman Sarab that the payouts would be processed by 10 o'clock.
- Chhaya explained that the payouts would not be completed through the app and assured Nirman Sarab that the request had been made.
- The agent mentioned that Lokesh in Bhopal was handling the transfer and offered to have Lokesh call Nirman Sarab directly for further assistance.","{'query_solution_pairs': [{'query': 'Customer asked if the payout of ₹90,000 and ₹12,90,000 will be done now.', 'agent_solution': ""The agent informed the customer that the payout request has been sent and it will be done by 10 o'clock.

However, the agent offered to ask Lokesh to call the customer.'}]}",0,"The agent's greeting was inadequate. The agent started the conversation with 'Hello. This is Chhaya from Choice Clinics. Can I assist you?' While the agent did introduce themselves and the company, the greeting lacked a polite and professional tone. It was abrupt and did not include a courteous salutation such as 'Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening.' Additionally, the agent did not ask how they could assist the customer in a more open-ended manner, which could have set a more welcoming tone for the conversation. 

To improve, the agent could use a more structured and polite greeting, such as: 'Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is Chhaya from Choice Clinics. How may I assist you today?' This would make the interaction more professional and customer-friendly.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:** The agent repeatedly says, ""Yes, sir. Payout request has gone. You will get it by today, sir."" without addressing the customer's concern about the app usage and the timing of the payout.

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:** The customer expressed confusion and concern about using the app for payouts and the timing of the payout. The agent did not acknowledge these concerns or provide a clear explanation or reassurance about the process.

**Suggested improvement:** The agent could have said, ""I understand you're concerned about using the app for payouts and the timing. Let me clarify the process for you and ensure you receive the payout by the expected time. If you're not comfortable using the app, I can guide you through it or offer an alternative solution.""",0,"The agent did not provide any closure statement at the end of the call. The conversation ended abruptly with the agent saying, 'Yes, I'll call you,' without confirming if there was anything else the customer needed or thanking the customer for their time. Additionally, there was no mention of a feedback request or CSAT survey, which is part of the closure guidelines. This leaves the customer without a clear end to the interaction and without an invitation to provide feedback on the service received, which is important for service improvement and customer satisfaction assessment. 

Suggestion: The agent could have said, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day! After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.' This would provide a clear and courteous closure to the call and invite the customer to provide feedback.",1,"The agent, Chhaya, displayed a lack of empathy throughout the conversation. The interaction was primarily focused on technical details and procedural explanations without acknowledging the customer's frustration or concerns. Here are specific issues:

1. **Lack of Empathetic Language:** Chhaya did not use any empathetic phrases such as ""I understand your frustration"" or ""I can see why this is concerning for you."" Instead, the conversation was filled with repetitive confirmations and procedural details.

2. **Missed Opportunities for Empathy:** When the customer expressed confusion and frustration about the payout process and the use of the app, Chhaya could have acknowledged these feelings and offered reassurance. For example, saying ""I understand this process can be confusing, and I'm here to help you through it"" would have been more empathetic.

3. **Focus on Technical Details:** The agent focused solely on the technical aspects of the payout process without addressing the customer's emotional state or providing any comfort or assurance.

To improve empathy, Chhaya could have:
- Used empathetic language to acknowledge the customer's feelings.
- Personalized responses to show understanding of the customer's specific situation.
- Offered reassurance and support, rather than just procedural information.",3,"The agent, Chhaya, maintains a polite tone throughout the conversation but struggles to effectively manage the customer's frustration and confusion. While she does not escalate the situation, there are several missed opportunities to acknowledge the customer's concerns and provide reassurance.

1. **Acknowledging Frustration**: The agent could have used more empathetic language to acknowledge the customer's frustration. For example, instead of repeatedly saying ""Yes, sir,"" she could have said, ""I understand this is frustrating, and I'm here to help resolve it.""

2. **Clarifying Information**: The conversation is somewhat disjointed, with the agent not clearly explaining the payout process or the reasons for the delay. She could have said, ""Let me explain the process to ensure you understand why there might be a delay.""

3. **Providing Reassurance**: The agent could have reassured the customer by saying, ""I will make sure to follow up with Lokesh and ensure you receive a call back to resolve this issue.""

Overall, while the agent remains polite, she could improve her communication by being more empathetic and providing clearer explanations to help calm the customer and address their concerns more effectively.",1,"The agent's adherence to the script was extremely poor, warranting a score of 1. Here are the justifications and explanations for each deduction:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. Instead of introducing themselves as per the script, the agent said, ""Hello. This is Chhaya from Choice Clinics. Can I assist you?"" The script requires a more formal introduction, such as ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" The agent should have used the script's greeting to set a professional tone.

2. **Verification**: Although verification was not required in this call, the agent did not follow the script's guidance on addressing the client by name for a personal touch. The script suggests confirming the client's identity, which was not done appropriately.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not listen to the customer's query properly. The conversation was disjointed, and the agent did not allow the customer to express their concerns fully before responding. The script advises, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. I’m here to listen and assist you."" The agent should have allowed the customer to finish speaking without interruptions.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent failed to reconfirm the customer's query. The script suggests summarizing the issue to ensure understanding, which was not done. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent did provide some information about the payout, it was not clear or concise as per the script's guidance. The script requires a clear solution, such as ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure to the call. The script suggests asking if there is anything else the customer needs and thanking them for their time, which was not done. The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent's performance was far from the script's requirements, leading to a score of 1 for complete non-adherence.",

**Solutions provided by the agent:**
- The agent informed the customer that they needed to email care@choiceindia.com to request a holding statement for the F&O segment, mentioning the client ID.
- The agent explained that the F&O segment activation would take 48 hours of working time after the request was generated.
- The agent clarified that the customer's daughter needed to send the email from her registered mail ID, swarnakarpriya23@gmail.com.
- The agent provided the email address for sending the request and instructed the customer on what to mention in the email for the holding statement.
- The agent guided the customer on how to raise a request for account activation through the Choice Finx application and upload necessary documents.

The transcript starts with the customer saying 'Good morning, Choice for Excel,' and the agent responds with 'Good morning, Madam.' This response lacks a professional introduction and does not include the agent's name or the company name, which are essential components of a professional greeting. The agent should have introduced themselves and the company, and offered assistance in a more structured manner, such as 'Good morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would have set a more professional tone for the call and provided clarity to the customer about who they are speaking with.",,0,"**Exact part where the agent failed to listen:**
The agent repeatedly asked for the customer's daughter's number and email, even after the customer had already provided it. For example, the agent said, ""Can you give me her number?"" and ""So, what is the mail ID?"" after the customer had already provided this information.

**Why this shows the agent did not listen properly:**
The agent did not acknowledge the information the customer had already provided, which indicates they were not fully attentive to the customer's responses. This can lead to frustration for the customer as they have to repeat themselves unnecessarily.

**Suggested improvement:**
The agent could have said, ""Thank you for providing your daughter's number and email. Let me guide you through the next steps."" This would show that the agent was attentive and ready to assist further without making the customer repeat information.",0,"The agent's closure was: ""Thank you for calling Choice Banks. Have a nice day."" This closure was insufficient because it did not include a feedback request, which is part of the closure guidelines. Additionally, the agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with, which is a key part of ensuring the customer feels their needs have been fully addressed before ending the call. 

To improve the closure, the agent could have said: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services. Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates minimal empathy towards the customer. Throughout the conversation, the agent focuses primarily on the procedural aspects of the customer's request without acknowledging the customer's frustration or emotions. For instance, when the customer expresses confusion and frustration about the process, the agent does not use any empathetic language to acknowledge these feelings. Instead, the agent repeatedly provides technical instructions without addressing the customer's emotional state.

Problematic Phrases:
- The agent repeatedly says, ""Yes, sir,"" and ""You will have to mail it first,"" without acknowledging the customer's frustration or confusion.
- When the customer expresses that the process is a ""big problem"" and ""a big mess,"" the agent does not respond with any empathetic language or attempt to reassure the customer.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- The agent could have said, ""I understand this process can be quite frustrating, and I apologize for any inconvenience. Let me guide you through it step by step to make it easier for you.""
- When the customer mentioned the process being a ""big mess,"" the agent could have responded with, ""I can see why this might feel overwhelming. Let's work through it together to ensure everything is set up correctly.""

By incorporating these empathetic responses, the agent could have improved the customer's experience and demonstrated a higher level of empathy.",3,"The agent maintained a generally polite tone throughout the conversation, but there were several areas where the agent could have improved their professionalism and empathy. 

1. **Repetition and Clarity**: The agent repeated instructions multiple times without checking if the customer understood them. For example, the agent repeatedly said, ""You will have to mail it first,"" without confirming if the customer understood the process. A more effective approach would have been to ask, ""Do you have any questions about the process?"" or ""Would you like me to clarify any part of the instructions?""

2. **Empathy and Acknowledgment**: The agent did not acknowledge the customer's frustration with the process. When the customer expressed that it was a ""big problem"" and a ""big mess,"" the agent could have said, ""I understand this process can be a bit cumbersome, and I apologize for any inconvenience. Let me help guide you through it.""

3. **Professionalism in Addressing Concerns**: The agent could have been more proactive in addressing the customer's concerns about fees and the process. Instead of just stating the fees, the agent could have added, ""I can understand how important it is to know the costs involved. Once your F&O segment is activated, I'll be happy to provide you with detailed information.""

Overall, while the agent was polite, they missed opportunities to show empathy and ensure the customer fully understood the process, which would have enhanced the professionalism of the interaction.",2,"1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script for greeting. The script specifies a structured greeting, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" The agent simply said, ""Good morning, Choice for Excel,"" which is incorrect and does not include the agent's name or the company's correct name. 
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not properly listen to the customer's query. The customer was explaining their issue, but the agent interrupted and did not summarize the query as per the script's instructions.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have allowed the customer to finish and then said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

3. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did provide a solution, but it was not clear and concise as per the script's requirement. The explanation was lengthy and could have been more structured.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have provided a clear step-by-step solution and confirmed understanding with the customer.

4. **Closure**: The agent did not provide a proper closure. The script specifies asking if there is anything else the customer needs and thanking them for their time.
   - **Suggestion**: The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

Overall, the agent showed significant deviations from the script, particularly in greeting, listening, and closure, which resulted in a score of 2.",
