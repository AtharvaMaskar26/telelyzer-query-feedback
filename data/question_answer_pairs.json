        "agent_solution": "The agent checked and confirmed that the order was executed at 11:06, and 300 quantities were sold. The order was executed, but the trading balance is not showing because it will show in today's position and not after settlement.",
        "actual_answer": "Based on the information provided in the retrieved documents, it seems like you may have placed an After Market Order (AMO) yesterday.

The orders are then executed at the opening market rate when the stock exchange opens at 9:15 AM.\n\nTherefore, if you tried to execute your order today before 9:15 AM, it may not have been processed yet as the AMO orders are executed at the opening market rate. It is recommended to wait until after 9:15 AM for your order to be executed based on the information provided regarding the AMO process."

One possible reason could be that the user may have open or carry-forward positions that are currently attracting mark-to-market (MTM) losses, which can impact the available balance for trading.

        "agent_solution": "The agent suggested placing a limit order since the market order was not successful previously. They confirmed that the limit order was successful.",
        "actual_answer": "Based on the information provided in the retrieved documents, if you want to buy crude oil at a specific price of Rs. 5800, you should consider placing a Limit Order. \n\nA Limit Order allows you to set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell a stock or contract. By placing a Buy Limit Order at Rs. 5800 for crude oil, you can control the exact price at which your order will be executed. This means that your order will only be executed if the price of crude oil reaches Rs. 5800 or lower.\n\nOn the other hand, a Market Order executes at the current market price immediately. If you are particular about buying crude oil at Rs. 5800 or lower, a Limit Order would be more suitable for your requirement.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, it is recommended to place a Buy Limit Order for crude oil at Rs. 5800 to ensure that you purchase it at your desired price level."

        "actual_answer": "The profit and loss showing as minus in your trading positions could be due to the current market value of your positions being lower than the invested value. This results in a negative overall gain or loss figure. To investigate further and understand why your profit and loss are negative, you can review the details of each trade in the Positions Tab of the app. Check if there have been any recent market movements or specific trades that have contributed to the negative P&L. Additionally, you can analyze the booked P&L and overall profit and loss to identify any potential reasons for the negative values.

        "actual_answer": "Based on the information provided in the retrieved documents, it seems like you are referring to the balance in your trading account after selling certain shares. To address your query about the discrepancy in your balance, it's important to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Market Fluctuations**: The value of shares can fluctuate based on market conditions. If the share price decreased between the time you sold the shares on the 3rd and today, it could explain the decrease in your balance.\n\n2. **Charges and Fees**: There might be charges or fees associated with trading activities, such as brokerage fees, transaction charges, or other applicable fees. These deductions could impact your overall balance.\n\n3. **Margin Requirements**: If you have pledged shares or used them as collateral for trading, the margin requirements and any adjustments made against the pledged shares could affect your available balance.\n\n4. **Order Execution**: The execution of your sell orders, including any pending orders or partial executions, could also influence the final balance in your account.\n\nTo get a clearer understanding of the specific reasons for the balance discrepancy, I recommend reviewing your transaction history, trade confirmations, and any applicable charges or deductions associated with your recent trades.
