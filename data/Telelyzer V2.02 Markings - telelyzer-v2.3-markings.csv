Have a nice day.","The customer called the Police and Inquiry department with a query regarding a referral form for Choice Finx. The agent explained that by referring a person and opening an account to place the first trade, the customer would receive Rs. 500 credited to their wallet. The agent clarified that this amount would be used for brokerage reduction and could not be withdrawn or used for trading purposes. The customer inquired about the concept of brokerage reduction, to which the agent explained that it involved a Rs. 500 reduction on the generated amount. The call ended with the customer expressing understanding and no further queries.","[{'query': 'What is the referral form and how does it work?', 'agent_solution': 'The referral form allows you to refer a person. Once the referred person opens an account and places their first trade, you will be credited Rs. 500 in your wallet. However, this amount cannot be withdrawn or used for trading.', 'actual_answer': 'To refer your friends and family to Choice, you can use the referral program offered by the company.

So, start referring today and reap the benefits of our referral program!'}, {'query': 'What is meant by Brokerage Reduction?', 'agent_solution': 'Brokerage Reduction refers to the reduction of Rs. 500 on the brokerage amount generated. This amount is not available for withdrawal or trading purposes.', 'actual_answer': 'Brokerage reduction refers to the decrease in the fees or charges imposed by a brokerage firm for facilitating trades or providing investment services. This reduction can be in the form of lower commission rates, discounted fees, or special offers to attract clients. It is a strategy used by brokerage firms to make their services more competitive and appealing to investors. If you are looking for specific information on brokerage reduction at a particular brokerage firm, I recommend reaching out to their customer support or checking their official website for any ongoing promotions or updates related to brokerage fees.'}]",3,"The agent's response is partially correct but misses several key details and includes inaccurate information. 

1. The agent mentions a referral form, which is not part of the actual process described in the actual response. The actual response specifies using a personalized referral link, not a form.

2. The agent states that Rs. 500 will be credited after the first trade, but the actual response does not specify any monetary reward or condition related to trading. It only mentions rewards and benefits without specifics.

3. The agent's response lacks the broader context of the referral program, such as the encouragement to start referring and the general benefits of the program.

4. The agent incorrectly states that the credited amount cannot be withdrawn or used for trading, which is not mentioned in the actual response.

Overall, the agent's response is somewhat related to the referral process but contains significant inaccuracies and omissions, leading to a score of 4. The agent should focus on providing accurate details about the referral process, including the use of a personalized referral link and the general benefits of the program, without adding incorrect specifics about rewards or restrictions. The agent's response is largely incorrect and does not align with the actual concept of brokerage reduction as described in the knowledge base. The agent incorrectly specifies a fixed amount (Rs. 500) as the reduction, which is misleading and not universally applicable. Brokerage reduction generally refers to a decrease in fees or charges, which can vary and is not limited to a specific amount. Additionally, the agent's response lacks the broader context of why brokerage reductions are offered and how they can vary between firms. This could lead to customer confusion, as the explanation is not clear and only loosely related to the correct solution. The agent should have explained that brokerage reduction involves lower commission rates or discounted fees, and suggested checking with specific brokerage firms for details, as per the actual response.",1,"The agent did not adhere well to the provided script. Here are the areas where the script was not followed, along with suggestions for improvement:

1. **Greeting:**
   - **What the agent said:** ""Good morning, Police and Inquiry. How can I help you in any way?""
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification:**
   - The agent did not perform any verification of the caller's identity, which is crucial for security and personalization.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""May I confirm, is this Mr. [Client's Name] speaking?"" or ""I see that the number you are calling from is not registered in our system. To proceed, we will need to verify your identity by confirming 3 out of the following 5 details: [list details].""

3. **Listening to the Query:**
   - The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query:**
   - The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the customer's query.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution:**
   - The agent provided information but did not clearly state it as a solution to the customer's query.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries:**
   - There was no mention of a Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT for resolution.""

7. **Closure:**
   - **What the agent said:** ""Do you have any other information? No, ma'am. Thank you for calling Choice Finx. Have a nice day.""
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT):**
   - The agent did not request feedback from the customer.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

Overall, the agent needs to follow the script more closely to ensure a consistent and professional customer service experience.","The agent's adherence to the script was very poor, warranting a score of 1. Here are the reasons for the deductions:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the prescribed greeting. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent said, ""Good morning, Police and Inquiry. How can I help you in any way?"" This is incorrect and does not align with the script.

2. **Verification**: There was no attempt to verify the customer's identity, which is a crucial step in the script. The agent should have confirmed the customer's identity by asking, ""May I confirm, is this Mr. XYZ speaking?"" or followed the non-registered number protocol.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not ask the customer to explain their concern in detail, nor did they demonstrate active listening as per the script's guidance.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the customer's query, which is essential to ensure understanding and accuracy.

5. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent provided some information, it was not clear or structured as per the script's guidelines. The agent should have said, ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**: There was no mention of a Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues, which is a critical part of the script.

7. **Closure**: The agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with, nor did they thank the customer properly as per the script.

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: The agent did not request feedback, which is an important step in the script.

Overall, the agent failed to follow the script in almost all aspects, leading to a score of 1. The agent needs to adhere closely to the script in future interactions to ensure consistency and quality in customer service.",0,"The agent did not properly greet the customer according to the standard greeting protocol. The greeting used was 'Good morning, Police and Inquiry. How can I help you in any way?' which is not appropriate for a Choice Finx customer service call. The agent should have introduced themselves and the company they represent, such as 'Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would have provided a clear introduction and set the right tone for the call. The lack of a proper introduction and company identification is why the score is 0.",1,"The agent in this transcript showed no empathy towards the customer. The conversation was purely transactional and focused solely on providing technical details about the referral form and brokerage reduction. The agent did not acknowledge the customer's feelings or concerns at any point. 

For example, when the customer expressed confusion or sought clarification with 'What do you mean by Brokerage Reduction?' and 'You mean the amount will not be withdrawn?', the agent simply repeated the information without any empathetic language or attempt to understand the customer's perspective. 

The agent could have improved by using phrases like, 'I understand this can be a bit confusing, let me explain it further,' or 'I can see why this might be frustrating, let me help clarify this for you.' These phrases would have shown that the agent was not only providing information but also acknowledging the customer's potential confusion or frustration.",0,"The agent did not follow the reference script for providing closure. The agent's closure phrase was: ""Thank you for calling Choice Finx. Have a nice day."" This phrase does not include asking if there is anything else the customer needs assistance with, which is a crucial part of ensuring the customer feels fully supported and that all their concerns have been addressed. The agent should have said something like: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!"" This would have ensured a more complete and customer-focused closure.",,0,"The agent did not demonstrate effective listening skills in the transcript. The customer was trying to understand the referral form and the concept of 'Brokerage Reduction'. However, the agent did not allow the customer to fully express their concerns or questions before responding. The agent also failed to reconfirm the customer's query to ensure understanding.

1. **Lack of Active Listening:** The agent did not invite the customer to explain their concern in detail. Instead, the agent immediately started explaining the referral form without confirming if that was the customer's main concern. A better approach would have been: ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

2. **Failure to Reconfirm the Query:** The agent did not summarize the customer's query to confirm understanding. The agent could have said: ""Just to confirm, you are asking about the referral form and how the brokerage reduction works. Let me explain that for you.""

3. **Interruptions and Lack of Clarification:** The agent did not clarify the customer's question about 'Brokerage Reduction' effectively. The customer asked, ""What do you mean by Brokerage Reduction?"" but the agent's response was not clear or detailed enough to address the customer's confusion. A more effective response would have been: ""Brokerage Reduction means that Rs. 500 will be deducted from the brokerage generated, and this amount cannot be withdrawn or used for trading. Does that clarify your question?""

Overall, the agent's responses were not tailored to the customer's specific queries, indicating a lack of attentive listening.",5,"The agent maintained excellent control throughout the conversation. They were calm, polite, and focused on providing clear information to the customer. There were no signs of frustration or impatience, and the agent used polite language such as 'Yes, ma'am' and 'Yes, sir.' The agent effectively addressed the customer's queries without any signs of stress or defensiveness. The conversation was smooth, and the agent ensured the customer understood the referral process without escalating the situation. Therefore, the agent deserves a score of 5 for excellent control.",1,2.79/9*

The actual response focuses on troubleshooting connectivity issues with the mobile app by checking the internet connection, restarting the app, and updating it. It also advises contacting customer support for more information about Odin software, which is not mentioned in the retrieved documents.

In contrast, the agent incorrectly suggests downloading Odin software, which is not part of the recommended troubleshooting steps. This could lead the customer in the wrong direction and potentially cause more confusion. Additionally, the agent's request for a screen recording is not mentioned in the actual response and may not be necessary for resolving the issue.

The agent's response lacks the correct troubleshooting steps and guidance provided in the actual response, which is why it scores a 2 for being in the wrong direction and not aligning with the knowledge base or customer issue. The agent's response is rated a 2 because it does not align with the knowledge base or address the customer's issue effectively. The agent's solution of requesting a screen recording and forwarding it to the technical department is not a direct troubleshooting step and does not provide immediate assistance to the customer. 

The actual response provides a detailed troubleshooting guide, including checking the Positions Tab, verifying market data, checking trade details, and customizing chart features. These steps are actionable and directly address the customer's issue with market data not reflecting properly in the app.

The agent's response lacks these critical steps and instead suggests a passive approach that could delay resolution. To improve, the agent should have guided the customer through the troubleshooting steps outlined in the actual response before escalating the issue to the technical department. The agent's response is largely misaligned with the actual solution provided in the knowledge base. The customer's concern is about the lack of movement in the application and the inability to see changes in market trends, which can be addressed by using the Advanced Charting feature. However, the agent's response focuses on escalating the issue to the technical department and requesting a screen recording, which is not relevant to the solution described. This indicates a misunderstanding of the customer's issue and the available solution. The agent's response does not provide any guidance on how to use the Advanced Charting feature, which is the key to resolving the customer's concern. Therefore, the response is rated a 2, as it is in the wrong direction and does not align with the knowledge base or the customer's issue. To improve, the agent should have explained the Advanced Charting feature and how it can help the customer monitor market trends and make informed trading decisions.",2,"The agent did not adhere well to the provided script.

   - What the agent could have said: ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification**:
   - The agent did not verify the customer's identity as per the script.
   - What the agent said: The agent did not ask for any verification details.
   - What the agent could have said: ""May I confirm, is this Mr. [Customer's Name] speaking?"" or if it was a non-registered number, proceed with the verification process outlined in the script.

3. **Listening to the Query**:
   - The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail.
   - What the agent said: The agent jumped into discussing the technical issue without prompting the customer to explain their concern.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**:
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's issue to confirm understanding.
   - What the agent said: The agent continued the conversation without summarizing the issue.

   - The agent did not provide a clear and concise solution or a TAT for resolution.
   - What the agent said: The agent mentioned forwarding the issue but did not provide a specific solution or timeline.
   - What the agent could have said: ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution]. If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT for resolution.""

6. **Closure**:

2. **Verification**: There was no attempt to verify the customer's identity, which is a crucial step in the script. The agent should have confirmed the customer's identity by asking, ""May I confirm, is this Mr. XYZ speaking?"" or followed the non-registered number protocol if applicable.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did listen to the customer's issue but did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail as per the script. The agent could have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize the customer's issue to confirm understanding, which is an important step to ensure clarity. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

The agent could have started the call with a greeting such as, 'Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?'

While the agent does acknowledge the customer's issue, they do so only when prompted by the customer and do not use empathetic language proactively. The agent's responses are mostly technical and procedural, focusing on what the customer should do next (e.g., providing a screen recording) rather than expressing understanding or concern for the customer's frustration.

The agent could have improved their empathy by using phrases like, ""I can see why this is frustrating for you,"" or ""I understand how this issue is impacting your experience."" Instead, the agent's responses are more focused on the technical aspects and next steps without acknowledging the customer's emotional state. For example, when the customer expresses confusion and frustration about the lack of movement in the application, the agent could have said, ""I understand how concerning it must be to see no movement in your application.

To improve, the agent should have concluded the call with a clear closure statement, ensuring the customer felt acknowledged and appreciated for their time.",,0,"The agent did not effectively listen to the customer's query throughout the conversation. Here are the reasons for the score:

1. **Failure to Understand the Core Issue**: The customer repeatedly mentioned issues with the mobile app and the lack of movement in the market data, but the agent did not address these concerns directly. Instead, the agent focused on unrelated aspects like downloading Odin software, which the customer clearly stated they did not understand or use. 
   - **Transcript Phrase**: ""Sir, do you want to download Odin software, or do you want to know about the application?""
   - **Improvement**: The agent could have said, ""I understand you are facing issues with the market data not updating on your mobile app. Let's focus on resolving that.""

2. **Lack of Clarification and Reconfirmation**: The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the customer's main issue, which is crucial for ensuring both parties are on the same page.
   - **Transcript Phrase**: ""Yes, sir, I understand. As if there is no movement in the application, it stays still.""
   - **Improvement**: The agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you are experiencing a lack of movement in the market data on your app, correct? Let me check that for you.""

3. **Inadequate Solution Offering**: The agent did not provide a clear solution or next steps to address the customer's issue. Instead, they repeatedly asked for screen recordings without explaining how this would help resolve the issue.
   - **Transcript Phrase**: ""Please take a proper screen recording of any random script.""
   - **Improvement**: The agent could have said, ""Thank you for your patience. Please provide a screen recording so our technical team can analyze the issue and provide a solution.""

However, there are several instances where the agent could have better acknowledged the customer's frustration and provided more empathetic responses. For example, the agent repeatedly asks for screen recordings and screenshots without directly addressing the customer's immediate frustration or confusion about the Odin software. The agent also uses repetitive phrases like ""Please release it once"" and ""We will forward it,"" which may come across as dismissive or not fully engaged with the customer's issue. These responses could be improved by using more empathetic language, such as ""I understand this is frustrating for you, and I'm here to help resolve it as quickly as possible."" Additionally, the agent could have taken more time to explain the steps clearly and reassure the customer that their issue is being prioritized.

This is Vimal speaking. Vimala. Vimala Nihari. Yes, Vimala Nihari. Yes. Yes, tell me, sir. Hello? Yes, sir, tell me. Hello? Hello? Yes, tell me. I have received an email for a back office report, but the way the report is sent is not right. You can't do anything with that report, so I want to talk to the back office only. Which report do you want, sir? Since the time my account has been opened. Date, stock name, quantity, price, basic details. And that is not even basic details. You can also open the report from yesterday. If you have access, you can open it and see, so you can understand what is in the report. Yesterday, I got both the accounts. I got the mail for both the accounts. It took 3 days, but after waiting for 3 days, I found out that the report is not correct. Yes, this is the email for both the accounts, 1082 and 1090. So, I received 2 Excel reports and 2 PDF reports. I have a question about that too. What is the difference between a PDF report and an Excel report? Sir, you can't copy and paste in PDF. You can download it in Excel. No, that is possible; you can do it in Google and convert PDF to Excel. But the format is very strange. If you check, I will put a filter. Basically, in Excel and PDF, let's assume that the Excel data is the correct format, but the date is missing in it. If I get it provided on Excel, the PDF data... So, wherever you have downloaded it, you just have to convert it into a CSV report. Or you can tell me through the app where you can access it. If we have access, if you have access, then send me the mail format in Excel, with which I can filter and basically check it, right? You see the number of scripts, think about it, there are 200 scripts, and its filter will not be visible in my PDF. So, you can revert to it. What should I write in the report? What is the name of the first PDF report, and what is the name of the Excel one? Excel, PDF, sir, it is global, it is global. And the date in Excel is not coming, so I don't know if my script is there or not. Is there anything missing or not? Because the date is not coming, so I am getting a lot of confusion. I am getting a date for PGS, but I can't work in Excel. I mean, both the reports got invalidated for me. If there were a couple of scripts, I would have been able to do something. I mean, there are a lot of n-number of scripts. I spent half an hour on it, spent some time on it, and finally saw the gear. I'll talk about the gear. I mean, it didn't get fruitful from the record. They have sent it, so forward it to the mail right now. Ok, but the tag timing is around 48 hours. It will take 2-3 days; I will get it back. No, no, tell them to send it to the mail. Ok, should I mention it in the mail? Yes, yes, sir.","The customer, Vimala Nihari, called Jain Clinic regarding an issue with the back office report received via email. The customer mentioned that the report did not contain the necessary details such as date, stock name, quantity, and price. They also expressed confusion about the difference between PDF and Excel reports. The agent explained that PDF reports do not allow copying and pasting, while Excel reports can be downloaded and manipulated easily. The customer requested the report in Excel format for better filtering and analysis. The agent assured the customer that the issue would be resolved within 48 hours but the customer insisted on receiving the corrected report sooner. The agent agreed to forward the concern to the appropriate department and mentioned that the customer's request would be included in the email.","[{'query': ""I have received an email for a back office report, but the way the report is sent is not right.

The customer is facing an issue with a back office report sent via email, and the correct action is to direct them to contact the back office team for assistance. Instead, the agent asked for clarification on which report the customer wanted and suggested opening a report from yesterday, which does not address the customer's issue of being unable to take action with the report. This response could lead to customer frustration as it does not provide a path to resolution. The agent should have provided the contact information for the back office team as per the actual response. The agent's response is inaccurate and misses the main point of the customer's query. The customer asked about the difference between a PDF report and an Excel report, but the agent focused on the ability to copy and paste, which is not the core of the question. The agent also mentioned converting PDF to Excel, which is not relevant to the original question about the differences between the two report formats. 

The actual response correctly acknowledges the lack of specific information and offers further assistance, which is a more appropriate approach. The agent should have either provided a comparison of the two formats (e.g., static vs. editable, layout differences) or acknowledged the lack of specific information and offered further assistance, as the actual response did. This would have been more aligned with the customer's needs and the knowledge base. The agent's response is largely off the mark compared to the actual response. The actual response acknowledges the lack of specific information and suggests checking the Excel report settings, which is a logical step given the context. However, the agent's response suggests converting the report to CSV or accessing it through an app, which is not relevant to the issue at hand. This indicates a misunderstanding of the customer's problem and does not align with the knowledge base. Therefore, the response is in the wrong direction, warranting a score of 2. To improve, the agent should focus on understanding the customer's issue and provide guidance on checking report settings or request more details if necessary. The agent did not provide any solution to the customer's query, which is entirely incorrect and unhelpful. The actual response required the agent to provide detailed information on writing a report, including a portfolio overview and understanding contract notes, as well as naming the reports. Since the agent failed to address any part of the customer's request, the response is rated as completely wrong, leading to potential customer frustration or escalation. To improve, the agent should have provided the detailed steps and information as outlined in the actual response. The agent's response is completely incorrect and does not address the customer's issue as described in the actual response. The actual response indicates that there is no specific information available about reports getting invalidated and suggests contacting the support team or Relationship Manager. However, the agent's response talks about tag timing and sending something via mail, which is unrelated to the customer's issue. This misdirection could lead to customer frustration or escalation, hence the score of 1.",1,"The agent did not adhere to the provided script effectively. Here are the areas where the agent missed following the script and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Greeting**:
   - The agent did not use the correct greeting as per the script. Instead of ""Good morning, sir. This is Shahnaz speaking from Jain Clinic. How can I help you?"" the agent should have said:
     - ""Good Morning, this is Shahnaz calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification**:
   - The agent did not perform any verification of the customer's identity. According to the script, the agent should have confirmed the identity by asking:
     - ""May I confirm, is this Mr. Vimala Nihari speaking?"" or if it was a non-registered number, proceed with the verification process by confirming 3 out of the 5 details.

3. **Listening to the Query**:
   - The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail. The script suggests saying:
     - ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**:
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's issue to confirm understanding. The script suggests:
     - ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**:
   - The agent did not provide a clear and concise solution to the customer's query. The script suggests:
     - ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**:
   - The agent mentioned a vague timeline (""It will take 2-3 days"") without providing a specific TAT or offering a callback option. The script suggests:
     - ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT (Turnaround Time) for resolution. For any callback requests, we will ensure to contact you within 2 hours, either from my end or a senior agent's end.""

7. **Closure**:
   - The agent did not properly close the call. The script suggests:
     - ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**:
   - The agent did not request feedback from the customer. The script suggests:
     - ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

For future calls, the agent should closely follow the script to ensure a structured and professional interaction with the customer.","The agent did not adhere to the script at all. Here are the key points where the agent deviated from the script:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not use the prescribed greeting from the script. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent said, ""Good morning, sir. This is Shahnaz speaking from Jain Clinic. How can I help you?"" This is a significant deviation as the agent did not even mention the correct company name.

2. **Verification**: There was no attempt to verify the identity of the caller, which is a crucial step in the script. The agent should have asked for verification details if the number was not registered or confirmed the identity if it was.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not follow the script's guidance to listen to the query without interruption. The conversation was disjointed with multiple interruptions and unclear communication.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the query as instructed in the script. This step is important to ensure understanding and clarity.

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did not provide a clear and concise solution as per the script. The conversation was more about the client's issues without a structured response or solution.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**: The agent mentioned a vague timeline of ""2-3 days"" without providing a clear Turnaround Time (TAT) as per the script.

7. **Closure and Feedback Request**: The agent did not follow the closure script or request feedback, which is an essential part of the call process.

Overall, the agent failed to follow the script in almost every aspect, leading to a score of 1. To improve, the agent should strictly adhere to the script, starting with the correct greeting, verification process, and structured handling of the query, including providing solutions and closure.",1,"The agent, Shahnaz, greeted the customer with a polite and clear greeting: 'Good morning, sir. This is Shahnaz speaking from Jain Clinic. How can I help you?' This greeting is appropriate as it includes a time-specific salutation ('Good morning'), introduces the agent by name ('This is Shahnaz'), identifies the organization ('from Jain Clinic'), and offers assistance ('How can I help you?'). This greeting is effective in setting a professional tone for the call and inviting the customer to state their issue. There is no need to cut marks as the greeting meets the standard expectations for a customer service interaction.",2,"The agent, Shahnaz, displayed minimal empathy throughout the interaction. She acknowledged the customer's issue only when prompted and did not use empathetic language proactively. For example, when the customer expressed frustration about the report format and the delay, Shahnaz did not acknowledge the customer's frustration or apologize for the inconvenience. Instead, she focused on the technical details of the report and the process of sending it again. 

Phrases that lacked empathy include:
- ""Yes, sir, tell me."" (repeatedly without addressing the customer's frustration)
- ""Sir, you can't copy and paste in PDF. You can download it in Excel."" (focusing on technical details without acknowledging the customer's confusion)

Instead, Shahnaz could have said:
- ""I understand how frustrating it must be to receive a report in the wrong format after waiting for several days. Let me see how I can help you resolve this quickly.""

Overall, the agent's responses were more focused on the technical aspects rather than understanding and addressing the customer's emotional state, which is why the score is a 2.",0,"The agent did not provide any closure to the customer. The conversation ended abruptly without any attempt to confirm if the customer's issue was resolved or if there was anything else they needed help with. The agent also did not thank the customer for their time or wish them a good day, which are essential components of a proper closure. The exact closure phrase was missing entirely. Instead, the agent could have said, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!' to provide a proper closure.",,0,"The agent in the transcript did not demonstrate effective listening skills. Here are the reasons for the score:

1. **Lack of Acknowledgment and Clarification:** The agent repeatedly asks ""Yes, sir, tell me"" without acknowledging the specific concerns raised by the customer. For example, when the customer mentions issues with the report format and the need to talk to the back office, the agent does not address these concerns directly or seek clarification. Instead, the agent should have said, ""I understand you're having issues with the report format and need to speak with the back office. Let me assist you with that.""

2. **Failure to Reconfirm the Query:** The agent does not summarize or reconfirm the customer's query at any point. The customer mentions multiple issues, including the difference between PDF and Excel reports, missing dates, and the need for a specific format. The agent should have reconfirmed by saying, ""Just to confirm, you're having trouble with the report format and missing dates in the Excel file, and you need assistance with that. Is that correct?""

3. **Interruptions and Lack of Engagement:** The agent frequently interrupts with ""Yes, sir, tell me"" without allowing the customer to fully express their concerns. This indicates a lack of engagement and understanding of the customer's issues.

4. **No Solution Provided:** The agent does not offer any solution or next steps to address the customer's concerns. Instead, the agent should have provided a clear solution or at least a plan to escalate the issue to the appropriate department.

Overall, the agent's responses indicate a lack of active listening and engagement with the customer's query, leading to a score of 0.",3,"The agent, Shahnaz, maintains a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempts to address the customer's concerns. However, there are several instances where the agent seems to struggle with effectively managing the customer's frustration. For example, the agent repeatedly asks ""Yes, sir, tell me"" without acknowledging the customer's frustration or providing reassurance. This could make the customer feel unheard or ignored. Additionally, the agent does not directly address the customer's confusion about the report formats or the missing data, which could have helped in calming the situation. Instead of repeatedly asking the customer to tell them the issue, the agent could have said, ""I understand your concern about the report format and missing data. Let me check this for you and see how we can resolve it."" This would have shown empathy and a proactive approach to solving the problem. Overall, the agent's responses are polite but lack the acknowledgment of the customer's frustration and a clear path to resolution, which is why the score is 3 for average control.",1,3.2399999999999998/9*

The actual response involves the platform's right to sell off holdings or auto-square off positions if the debit amount is not cleared or if there is insufficient margin for ITM positions. The agent, however, talks about a technical issue causing incorrect reflections and advises the customer not to buy or sell anything, which is unrelated to the actual problem. This misdirection could lead to customer frustration or escalation, hence the score of 1. The agent's response is largely unrelated to the customer's query about trading positions and option strategies, specifically the Bear Put Spread. The agent discussed limit and stop-loss orders, which are different concepts in trading. This indicates a misunderstanding of the customer's question and the relevant knowledge base information. 

The correct response should have focused on explaining the Bear Put Spread strategy, where a put option with a lower strike price is bought (positive position) and a put option with a higher strike price is sold (negative position). This strategy is used to potentially benefit from a moderate decrease in the underlying asset's price.

The agent's response is in the wrong direction, hence the score of 2. The agent's response is completely incorrect and unrelated to the customer's query about where to get a kilo of oil when ordering it. The agent's response talks about setting a limit or stop-loss, which is irrelevant to the customer's question. This indicates a misunderstanding of the customer's issue and does not provide any useful information or solution. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 1, as it is entirely incorrect and could lead to customer frustration. The agent's response is significantly misaligned with the actual response required to address the customer's issue. The actual response emphasizes the importance of contacting the relevant department or service provider to ensure timely bill generation and settlement, and suggests following up to avoid potential issues like delayed payment charges or impacts on trading activities. It also advises reaching out to customer support for further assistance if needed.

In contrast, the agent's response simply advises the customer to wait until 6 o'clock in the evening for the bill to be generated, without addressing the need for proactive follow-up or contacting the relevant parties. This advice does not align with the knowledge base or the customer's issue, as it lacks the necessary steps to resolve the problem and prevent potential complications.

The agent's response is in the wrong direction and does not provide a solution that aligns with the actual response, hence the score of 2.",1,"The agent did not adhere to the provided script effectively. Here are the areas where the script was not followed, along with suggestions for improvement:

1. **Greeting**:
   - **What the agent said**: ""Good morning, sir. I'm from Xerox. Can I speak to you?""
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification**:
   - The agent did not perform any verification of the customer's identity, which is crucial for security and personalization.
   - **What the agent could have said**: 
     - If it was a registered number: ""May I confirm, is this Mr. [Customer's Name] speaking?""
     - If it was a non-registered number: ""I see that the number you are calling from is not registered in our system. To proceed, we will need to verify your identity by confirming 3 out of the following 5 details: Mobile Number, PAN, Date of Birth, Address, Holding (any one script name).""

3. **Listening to the Query**:
   - The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**:
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's query to confirm understanding.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**:
   - The agent did provide some guidance but could have been clearer and more structured in their response.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**:
   - The agent did not mention any Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT (Turnaround Time) for resolution.""

7. **Closure**:
   - The agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with before ending the call.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**:
   - The agent did not request feedback from the customer.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

Overall, the agent needs to follow the script more closely to ensure a structured and professional interaction with the customer. This includes proper greeting, verification, listening, reconfirming the query, providing solutions, and closing the call with a feedback request.","The agent did not adhere to the script at all. Here are the reasons for the low score:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not use the prescribed greeting from the script. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent said, ""Good morning, sir. I'm from Xerox. Can I speak to you?"" This is a significant deviation from the script.

2. **Verification**: There was no attempt to verify the customer's identity as per the script. The script requires the agent to confirm the identity of the caller, especially if the number is not registered. This step was completely skipped.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not follow the script's guidance to allow the client to explain their concern in detail without interruption. The conversation was more about giving instructions rather than understanding the customer's issue.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize the customer's issue to confirm understanding, which is a crucial step in ensuring the correct issue is being addressed.

5. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent did provide some instructions, it was not done in a clear and concise manner as suggested by the script. The conversation was confusing and lacked clarity.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**: There was no mention of a Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues, which is an important part of managing customer expectations.

7. **Closure**: The agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with, nor did they thank the customer for their time, which is part of the script's closure process.

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: The agent did not mention the feedback request, which is important for service improvement.

Overall, the agent did not follow any part of the script, leading to a score of 1.

The agent simply said, 'Good morning, sir. I'm from Xerox. Can I speak to you?' This greeting lacks a proper introduction of the agent's name and the company they represent, which is essential for establishing a professional tone. Additionally, the phrase 'Can I speak to you?' is not a suitable way to start a customer service call, as it does not convey readiness to assist the customer. Instead, the agent could have said, 'Good morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Xerox. How may I assist you today?' This would have been a more professional and welcoming greeting, setting a positive tone for the rest of the call.",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates minimal empathy. The conversation is heavily focused on technical details and instructions without much acknowledgment of the customer's emotions or concerns. The agent does not use any empathetic language proactively and only addresses the customer's issues when prompted. For example, when the customer expresses confusion or concern about the positions and potential loss, the agent does not acknowledge the customer's feelings or provide reassurance. Instead, the agent could have said, ""I understand this situation can be confusing and concerning, especially with the technical issues. Let me help clarify this for you."" This would have shown more empathy and understanding of the customer's emotional state. The agent's responses are mostly technical and lack personalization, which is why the score is a 2.",1,"The agent did attempt to provide closure by asking, 'Any other information, sir?' which is similar to the reference script's 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today?' However, the agent did not follow up with a proper closing statement like 'Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!' Instead, the agent simply said, 'Thank you for this phone call. Have a nice day.' This is a minor deviation from the reference script, but it still conveys a polite closing. Therefore, the agent receives a score of 1 for partially following the closure protocol. To improve, the agent could have used the exact phrasing from the reference script to ensure consistency and completeness in closure.",,0,"The agent in the transcript did not demonstrate effective listening skills. Here are the reasons for the score:

1. **Failure to Reconfirm the Query:** The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the customer's query at any point. For example, when the customer was confused about the positions and the technical issue, the agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are seeing an error in your positions, and you want to know if they are squared off correctly. Let me check that for you.""

2. **Lack of Clarification:** The customer asked about putting something in minus, and the agent responded with ""Sir, I don't understand. What are you saying?"" without attempting to clarify or ask probing questions to understand better. A better response would have been, ""Could you please explain a bit more about what you mean by putting it in minus? I want to make sure I understand correctly.""

3. **Interruptions and Lack of Patience:** The agent did not allow the customer to fully express their concerns without interruption. The agent should have allowed the customer to finish speaking and then addressed their concerns.

4. **Inadequate Solution Explanation:** The agent did not provide a clear and concise solution to the customer's problem. The explanation about the technical issue and the squared-off positions was not clearly communicated, leading to further confusion for the customer.

Overall, the agent failed to demonstrate active listening and did not effectively address the customer's concerns, resulting in a score of 0.",3,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates average control over their emotions. They maintain a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempt to address the customer's concerns. However, there are several instances where the agent seems to struggle with communication, which could lead to customer frustration. For example, the agent repeats instructions multiple times (""Please go to the 12th floor""), which might indicate a lack of clarity or patience. Additionally, the agent does not directly acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion, particularly when the customer expresses concern about potential losses (""I heard that there will be a loss in it when I had to sell it""). Instead of addressing this concern directly, the agent continues with technical explanations. To improve, the agent could use more empathetic language, such as ""I understand this is confusing, let me help clarify,"" and ensure they are addressing the customer's emotional state as well as the technical issues. This would help in calming the situation and providing a more supportive experience.",1,3.1049999999999995/9*

Based on your query, here is the solution: Please take a screenshot of the issue and email it to customercare@choiceindia.com so we can investigate further.""

Overall, the agent's responses were disjointed and did not reflect active listening or understanding of the customer's problem, leading to a score of 0.",3,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates average control over their emotions. They maintain a generally polite tone and attempt to assist the customer with their issue. However, there are several instances where the agent's responses could be perceived as rushed or lacking in empathy, which prevents them from fully calming the customer or addressing their frustration effectively. 

For example, the agent says, ""You are coming here since many days. Do you have any problem with me? Or any other problem?"" This statement could be interpreted as defensive or impatient, which is not ideal for calming a frustrated customer. Instead, the agent could have said, ""I understand this has been an ongoing issue, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's work together to resolve it."" 

Additionally, the agent does not consistently acknowledge the customer's frustration or provide reassurance, which could have helped in de-escalating the situation. These factors contribute to the score of 3, indicating average control with room for improvement in handling customer frustration more effectively.",1,3.05/10*

The customer mentioned facing losses due to the high brokerage fees and feeling misled by the account manager. The agent acknowledged the issue and assured the customer that they would investigate and resolve the matter. The agent provided the customer with a complaint number and informed them that the team was working on the resolution. The customer requested updates and expressed frustration over the lack of response from the account manager.

The call concluded with the agent reassuring the customer that their concerns were being addressed and offering further assistance as needed.","[{'query': 'The customer was charged a brokerage fee of Rs. 50 per lot, but was initially informed it would be Rs. 20 per lot.

The customer was misinformed initially, and the agent confirmed the current brokerage rate.', 'actual_answer': ""The customer may have been charged a brokerage fee of Rs. 50 per lot instead of the initially informed Rs. 20 per lot due to various reasons such as additional charges like RMS square off charges, invocation charges, stamp duty charges, unpledge charges, or pledge charges that may have been applicable to the transaction. It's important to review the detailed list of brokerage charges provided on the Choice Techlab website to understand all the charges associated with trading on the platform.

The agent incorrectly states that the brokerage fee is Rs. 25 per lot, which contradicts the customer's experience of being charged Rs. 50 per lot. The agent fails to mention the possible additional charges that could have led to the discrepancy, such as RMS square off charges, invocation charges, stamp duty charges, unpledge charges, or pledge charges. Furthermore, the agent does not advise the customer to review the detailed list of brokerage charges on the Choice Techlab website or suggest contacting customer care for further clarification. These omissions and inaccuracies lead to a score of 4, as the response is only somewhat correct and lacks major details, potentially causing confusion for the customer. To improve, the agent should have acknowledged the possibility of additional charges and directed the customer to the appropriate resources for clarification. The agent's response is incomplete compared to the actual response. While the agent acknowledges the complaint and provides a complaint number, which is helpful, they fail to guide the customer on how to escalate the issue or provide the contact information for the dedicated customer care team at Choice Techlab. The actual response suggests emailing customercare@choiceindia.com with all relevant details for a prompt resolution, which is a crucial step missing in the agent's response. This omission leaves the customer without a clear path to resolve their issue, hence the score of 5 for an incomplete response. The agent's response is incomplete and misses key steps necessary to resolve the customer's issue. While the agent mentions coordination with the RM and promises to send a reminder, they fail to address the critical aspect of the pledged shares being squared off to recover outstanding amounts. The agent should have informed the customer about the potential consequences of not recovering the shares, such as the shares being sold to cover unpaid portions, and advised the customer to contact Choice Techlab directly to inquire about the status. This lack of crucial information leaves the issue unresolved and could lead to customer confusion or frustration. Therefore, the response is rated as a 5 for being incomplete. The agent's response is largely incorrect and does not align with the actual solution. The actual response clearly states that the customer should contact the Share Registrar Agent to provide additional evidence related to a complaint. However, the agent instructed the customer to reply to the customer service page with the complaint number, which is not the correct procedure according to the knowledge base. This misdirection could lead to customer frustration as it does not address the issue properly. The agent also offered to send a reminder, which is not mentioned in the actual response and does not contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the response is rated a 2 for being in the wrong direction and not providing the correct solution.",2,"The agent did a commendable job in handling the customer's query, but there are a few areas where adherence to the script could be improved. Here's a detailed feedback:

1. **Greeting**: 
   - The agent did not start the call with the prescribed greeting. 
   - **What the agent said**: The transcript does not include the initial greeting.
   - **What could have been said**: ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification**:
   - The agent asked for the customer's account name, which is a part of the verification process, but did not follow the script for registered or non-registered number verification.
   - **What the agent said**: ""First, confirm your name. What is your account name?""
   - **What could have been said**: ""May I confirm, is this Mr. Indy Armaan Khan speaking?"" (Assuming it was a registered number call).

3. **Listening to the Query**:
   - The agent allowed the customer to explain their issue without interruption, which is good practice.
   - **What the agent did well**: Listened to the customer's detailed explanation of their issue.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**:
   - The agent did not explicitly reconfirm the query by summarizing it.
   - **What could have been said**: ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**:
   - The agent provided information and updates regarding the brokerage and complaint status.
   - **What the agent did well**: Provided updates and checked the customer's mail and complaint status.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**:
   - The agent mentioned that the issue is still open and that they will send a reminder, but did not provide a specific TAT.
   - **What could have been said**: ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT for resolution.""

7. **Closure**:
   - The agent did not use the script's closure statement.
   - **What the agent said**: ""Okay, any other questions?""
   - **What could have been said**: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**:
   - The agent did not request feedback as per the script.
   - **What could have been said**: ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

Overall, the agent handled the customer's concerns with patience and provided necessary updates, but should focus on following the script more closely, especially in terms of greeting, verification, reconfirming the query, providing a TAT, closure, and requesting feedback. This will ensure a more structured and consistent customer service experience.","The agent's adherence to the script was poor, with several key areas of the script not followed correctly:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not start the call with the prescribed greeting. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" the agent directly engaged with the customer's query without a proper introduction. This is a significant deviation from the script.

2. **Verification**: The agent did not follow the verification process as outlined in the script. The script requires confirming the identity of the caller, especially if the number is not registered. The agent should have asked for verification details if the number was not registered, but this step was skipped.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did listen to the customer's query, which aligns with the script. However, the agent interrupted the customer multiple times, which goes against the script's instruction to let the customer express themselves fully before responding.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not effectively summarize the customer's issue before proceeding to provide a solution. The script requires a brief summary to ensure understanding, which was not done.

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent attempted to provide a solution but did not clearly communicate the steps or resolution process. The script requires a clear and concise solution, which was not evident in the conversation.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**: The agent mentioned sending a reminder to the team but did not provide a clear Turnaround Time (TAT) for resolution, as required by the script.

7. **Closure**: The agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with, nor did they thank the customer for their time, which is part of the script's closure process.

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: The agent did not mention the feedback request, which is an essential part of the script to gather customer satisfaction data.

Overall, the agent missed several critical components of the script, leading to a low adherence score. To improve, the agent should follow the script more closely, especially in greeting, verification, and closure, and ensure clear communication of solutions and TATs.",0,"The agent did not greet the customer at the beginning of the call. The conversation started directly with the customer's query without any formal greeting or introduction from the agent. A proper greeting sets a positive tone for the interaction and is essential for customer service. The agent could have started with a greeting such as, 'Good morning/afternoon, thank you for calling Choice. My name is [Agent's Name]. How may I assist you today?' This would have been a more professional and courteous way to begin the call.",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates minimal empathy towards the customer. While the agent acknowledges the customer's issue and provides some information, they do not use empathetic language proactively or show understanding of the customer's frustration. The agent's responses are mostly technical and procedural, focusing on confirming details and providing a complaint number, rather than addressing the customer's emotional distress or confusion.

For example, when the customer expresses frustration about the brokerage fees and the lack of response from the RM, the agent simply states, ""Please wait for a while,"" without acknowledging the customer's frustration or offering reassurance. A more empathetic response could have been, ""I understand how frustrating this situation must be for you, and I'm here to help resolve it as quickly as possible.""

Additionally, when the customer mentions the ongoing issue and lack of support, the agent could have shown more empathy by saying, ""I can see why this has been a difficult experience for you, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me do everything I can to expedite the resolution."" This would have demonstrated a deeper understanding of the customer's feelings and a commitment to resolving the issue.",0,"The agent did not provide proper closure to the call. The agent failed to ask the customer if there was anything else they could assist with, which is a crucial part of ensuring the customer feels their concerns have been fully addressed. Additionally, the agent did not thank the customer for their time or wish them a good day, which are important elements of a courteous and professional closure. The exact closure phrase used by the agent was ""Okay, any other questions?"" which is insufficient for proper closure. Instead, the agent could have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!"" to provide a more complete and satisfactory closure.",,0,"The agent did not demonstrate effective listening skills throughout the interaction. Here are the reasons for the score:

1. **Failure to Reconfirm the Query**: The agent did not effectively summarize or reconfirm the customer's main issue. The customer had a complex issue involving brokerage fees and miscommunication with their RM, but the agent did not clearly restate the problem to ensure understanding. A better approach would have been: ""Just to confirm, you are facing an issue with unexpected brokerage fees and miscommunication with your RM regarding the number of lots traded. Is that correct?""

2. **Lack of Empathy and Acknowledgment**: The agent did not acknowledge the customer's frustration or express empathy for the situation. The customer was clearly upset about the brokerage fees and lack of resolution, but the agent did not address these emotions. A more empathetic response could have been: ""I understand how frustrating this must be for you, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's work together to resolve this.""

3. **Interruptions and Lack of Clarification**: The agent interrupted the customer and did not seek clarification on certain points. For example, when the customer mentioned the RM's response and the brokerage issue, the agent did not ask for further details or clarification. Instead, the agent could have said: ""Could you please clarify what your RM told you about the brokerage fees and any promises made regarding refunds?""

4. **Inadequate Solution and Follow-up**: The agent did not provide a clear solution or follow-up plan. The customer was left with a vague promise of a reminder being sent, without a clear timeline or next steps. A more effective response would have been: ""I will escalate this issue to our team and ensure you receive a response within the next 48 hours. I will personally follow up with you to confirm the resolution.""

Overall, the agent's responses lacked the necessary elements of active listening, empathy, and effective problem-solving, leading to a score of 0.",3,"The agent maintained a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempted to address the customer's concerns by checking details and providing information. However, there were moments where the agent could have better acknowledged the customer's frustration and provided more empathetic responses. For example, when the customer expressed dissatisfaction with the brokerage fees and the lack of response from the RN, the agent could have used phrases like ""I understand this is frustrating for you"" or ""I apologize for the inconvenience you've experienced."" Instead, the agent focused on procedural responses, which might have come across as dismissive of the customer's emotional state. Additionally, the agent seemed to rush through some parts of the conversation, which could have been perceived as impatience. To improve, the agent should focus on acknowledging the customer's feelings and ensuring they feel heard and understood before moving on to procedural steps.",1,2.88/9*

The agent clarified that they do not initiate such calls and suggested that it might be from sub-brokers. The customer then asked about the process of releasing funds if a stock is sold, to which the agent explained that funds can be withdrawn at any time through the application, but quarterly payouts are also given based on exchange rules. The customer inquired about the timing of the next payout, to which the agent mentioned that it depends on exchange instructions and is typically done quarterly.

The customer can withdraw funds before the quarterly payout if desired.', 'actual_answer': ""Based on the retrieved documents, the process and timeline for the return of unused money deposited in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) is as follows:\n\n1. **Payment Deadline and Risk Management**: If payment is not made within T+1+5 (i.e., T+6) days, the risk management team will sell the unpaid securities in accordance with the RMS policy. These securities will be invoked into the CUSPA account to meet the exchangeâ€™s securities pay-in obligation.\n\n2. **Unpaid Securities Process**: Under the new process, if you purchase securities but fail to make payment, resulting in a negative balance in your trading ledger, the unpaid securities will be transferred to your demat account. This will happen on the T+1 day (settlement day) upon receipt of payout from the exchange. These securities will be automatically marked for pledge against the Client Unpaid Securities Pool Account (CUSPA).\n\nTherefore, if you have deposited money with the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and it remains unused or if you fail to make payment for securities purchased, the process involves transferring the unpaid securities to your demat account and marking them for pledge against the CUSPA account.

The actual response details a specific process involving the transfer of unpaid securities to a demat account and marking them for pledge against the CUSPA account, with a clear timeline of T+1 day after the settlement day. The agent, however, incorrectly discusses a refund process and quarterly payouts, which are not mentioned in the actual response. This misdirection could lead to customer confusion and frustration, as it does not address the customer's issue regarding the return of unused money deposited in the NSE. The agent's response is in the wrong direction, hence a score of 2 is appropriate. To improve, the agent should focus on explaining the process of handling unpaid securities and the importance of timely payment to avoid risks, as outlined in the actual response. The agent's response is inaccurate and lacks key details. The actual response suggests checking specific terms and conditions related to investments or funds, and advises contacting the investment provider for detailed information. The agent's response, however, incorrectly attributes the timing to the exchange's instructions and does not mention the importance of reviewing investment documents or contacting the provider. This omission of major details and misunderstanding of the context results in a score of 4, as the solution is only somewhat correct and misses critical information. The agent's response is completely incorrect and unrelated to the actual solution. The actual response explains the concept of 'Baskets,' which are investment opportunities with quarterly rebalancing. However, the agent's response incorrectly describes a scheme initiated by a separate department and involves automatic payouts that need to be manually added back if not wanted. This is not only inaccurate but also misleading, as it does not address the concept of 'Baskets' or their quarterly rebalancing. Therefore, the agent's response deserves a score of 1, as it provides a solution that is entirely incorrect and could lead to customer frustration or escalation. To improve, the agent should have explained the concept of 'Baskets' as a unique investment opportunity with quarterly rebalancing to align with market trends, as described in the actual response. The agent's response is rated a 2 because it is in the wrong direction and does not align with the actual response needed. The actual response should have provided information about the cost of broking at Choice Techlab, emphasizing transparency and the absence of additional fees for certain services. Instead, the agent asked for the customer's registered mobile number and client ID, which is irrelevant to the customer's query about brokerage costs. This approach could lead to customer frustration as it does not address the customer's question about fees and charges. To improve, the agent should have directly provided information about the brokerage costs, mentioned the transparency of fees, and directed the customer to the website or customer care for further details, as outlined in the actual response.",2,"The agent did not fully adhere to the provided script. Here are the areas where the agent missed following the script and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Greeting:**
   - The agent started with ""Good morning, sir. Can I talk to you for a minute? How can I help you?"" instead of the scripted greeting.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification:**
   - The agent did not follow the verification process properly. The agent should have confirmed the identity of the caller, especially since it was a non-registered number.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""I see that the number you are calling from is not registered in our system. To proceed, we will need to verify your identity by confirming 3 out of the following 5 details: Mobile Number, PAN, Date of Birth, Address, Holding (any one script name).""

3. **Listening to the Query:**
   - The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail.
   - **Improvement:** The agent could have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query:**
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's query to confirm understanding.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution:**
   - The agent provided information but did not clearly state a solution or next steps.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have provided a clear and concise solution based on the customer's query.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries:**
   - The agent did not mention any Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT (Turnaround Time) for resolution.""

7. **Closure:**
   - The agent did not follow the closure script properly.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT):**
   - The agent did not request feedback at the end of the call.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

Overall, the agent needs to adhere more closely to the script to ensure a consistent and professional customer service experience.","The agent's adherence to the script was poor, with several key areas of the script not followed correctly. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script's greeting. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent said, ""Good morning, sir. Can I talk to you for a minute? How can I help you?"" This deviates from the script's structure and lacks the personal touch of addressing the client's name.

2. **Verification**: The agent failed to properly verify the customer's identity. The script requires verification of identity, especially when the number is not registered. The agent only asked for the registered mobile number towards the end of the call, which should have been done earlier in the conversation.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail as per the script. The agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize the customer's query to confirm understanding, which is a crucial step in ensuring the customer's issue is correctly understood.

5. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent attempted to provide information, it was not clear or concise, and the agent did not thank the customer for their patience as suggested in the script.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**: The agent did not provide a Turnaround Time (TAT) for resolution or mention callback requests, which is a part of the script for unresolved issues.

7. **Closure**: The agent did not follow the script's closure statement. Instead of asking if there was anything else they could assist with and thanking the customer, the agent abruptly ended the call.

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: The agent did not mention the feedback request, which is an important part of the script to gather customer satisfaction data.

Overall, the agent missed several key components of the script, leading to a low adherence score. To improve, the agent should closely follow the script, ensuring all steps are covered, and maintain a structured and professional approach throughout the call.",0,"The agent did not provide a proper greeting at the beginning of the call. The initial interaction was 'Good morning, sir. Can I talk to you for a minute? How can I help you?' which lacks a formal introduction of the agent and the company. A proper greeting should include the agent's name and the company they are representing, as well as a polite inquiry about how they can assist the customer. This helps in setting a professional tone for the conversation and provides clarity to the customer about who they are speaking with. The agent could have improved the greeting by saying something like, 'Good morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would have provided a clear introduction and set a professional tone for the call.",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates minimal empathy towards the customer. The agent acknowledges the customer's issues only when prompted and does not use empathetic language proactively. For example, when the customer expresses confusion about the calls they received, the agent simply states, ""Sir, as we are from the Customer Care Head Office Department, we do not initiate any calls,"" without acknowledging the customer's confusion or frustration. A more empathetic response could have been, ""I understand that receiving unexpected calls can be confusing. Let me help clarify this for you."" 

Additionally, the agent focuses heavily on technical details and procedures without addressing the customer's feelings or concerns. For instance, when discussing the quarterly payouts, the agent could have said, ""I understand that waiting for payouts can be concerning. Let me explain how the process works to ease your worries."" 

Overall, the agent's responses are factual and procedural, lacking the empathetic language that would make the customer feel understood and valued. This is why the score is a 2, as the agent does not proactively use empathetic language and only acknowledges issues when directly prompted by the customer.",0,"The agent did not provide proper closure to the call. The conversation ended abruptly with the agent saying, 'I am not able to hear you. I will call you later.' This does not follow the reference script for closure, which includes asking if there is anything else the customer needs assistance with and thanking the customer for their time. The agent could have improved the closure by saying, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!' This would have ensured the customer felt acknowledged and the call ended on a positive note.",0,0,"The agent did not effectively listen to the customer's query, as evidenced by several instances in the transcript where the customer's concerns were not properly addressed or understood.

1. **Initial Query Misunderstanding**: The customer was trying to explain an issue related to calls they received, but the agent immediately jumped to asking if the query was related to the stock market without fully understanding the customer's initial concern. The agent should have said, ""Could you please explain more about the calls you received? I want to make sure I understand your concern fully.""

2. **Misinterpretation of Financial Query**: The customer was trying to understand the process of unused money and quarterly payouts, but the agent repeatedly misunderstood the question, assuming it was about selling stocks and initiating payouts. The agent should have clarified by saying, ""Just to confirm, you are asking about the process and timing of quarterly payouts for unused funds, correct?""

3. **Failure to Address Specific Questions**: The customer asked about the name of the scheme related to the payouts, but the agent did not provide a clear answer and instead deflected by saying it was handled by a separate department. The agent should have acknowledged the question and offered to find out more information or direct the customer to the appropriate department.

Overall, the agent failed to listen actively and confirm the customer's queries, leading to a lack of clear and helpful responses. This resulted in a score of 0.",3,"The agent maintains a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempts to address the customer's queries. However, there are several instances where the agent seems to struggle with understanding the customer's questions, leading to repeated clarifications and a somewhat rushed tone. For example, the agent repeatedly asks for clarification on the customer's query about fund release and quarterly payouts, which could indicate a lack of understanding or patience. Additionally, the agent does not acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion, which could have helped in calming the situation. Instead of saying, ""Sorry, sir?"" or ""I am not able to hear you,"" the agent could have used more empathetic language like, ""I apologize for any confusion, let me try to understand your concern better."" This would have demonstrated better control and understanding of the customer's needs. Overall, the agent's performance is average, as they remain polite but miss opportunities to fully address the customer's frustration and confusion.",1,2.6750000000000003/10*

This response does not provide any useful information or solution to the customer's problem, leading to potential confusion and frustration. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 1, as it is entirely incorrect and does not align with the knowledge base or the customer's issue. The agent's response is inaccurate and contains major errors. The actual response specifies that the settlement day is typically T+2 (Trade Date plus 2 business days), whereas the agent incorrectly states it as T+1 (Trade Date plus one day).

   - The agent did not verify the customer's identity, which is crucial for security and personalization.
   - **What the agent said**: The agent directly engaged with the customer's query without any verification.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""May I confirm, is this Mr. [Customer's Name] speaking?""

3. **Listening to the Query**:
   - The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail.
   - **What the agent said**: The agent responded to the customer's query without prompting them to explain fully.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**:
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's issue to confirm understanding.
   - **What the agent said**: The agent proceeded to provide information without reconfirming the query.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**:
   - The agent provided a solution but could have been clearer and more structured.
   - **What the agent said**: The agent provided fragmented information about the settlement process.
   - **What the agent could have said**: ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, the trade settlement will occur tomorrow, and you will receive 80% of the funds then.""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not start the call with the prescribed greeting. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent directly engaged with the customer's query without a proper introduction. This is a significant deviation from the script.

2. **Verification**: There was no attempt to verify the customer's identity, which is a crucial step in the script. The agent should have confirmed the customer's identity by asking for verification details, especially since the call transcript does not indicate that the number was registered.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did listen to the customer's query, but the conversation was disorganized and lacked clarity. The agent should have allowed the customer to explain their concern fully before responding, as per the script.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize the customer's issue to confirm understanding. The script requires the agent to briefly summarize the query to ensure they have understood it correctly.

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did provide a solution regarding the settlement of the trade, but the explanation was not clear and concise. The script emphasizes providing a clear and concise solution, which was not fully achieved.

6. **Closure and Feedback Request**: The agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with, nor did they thank the customer for their time or request feedback, which are essential parts of the script.

To improve, the agent should have ensured the customer understood the resolution and then used the closure phrases from the reference script to end the call on a positive note.",,0,"The agent did not demonstrate effective listening skills throughout the interaction. Here are the key points where the agent failed to listen properly:

1. **Initial Query Understanding**: The customer mentioned creating a trade that is being rejected, but the agent immediately jumped to checking limits without fully understanding the customer's issue. The agent should have first reconfirmed the query by saying, ""Just to confirm, you are facing an issue with a trade being rejected after creation. Let me check that for you.""

2. **Interruptions and Lack of Clarification**: The agent interrupted the customer multiple times and did not clarify the customer's concern about the trade rejection and the settlement process. Instead of interrupting, the agent should have allowed the customer to finish and then summarized the issue.

3. **Failure to Address Customer's Concerns**: The customer repeatedly asked about the settlement and when the money would come, but the agent did not provide a clear explanation. The agent should have said, ""Based on your query, the settlement process works as follows..."" and provided a detailed explanation.

4. **Confusion and Repetition**: The agent repeated information without addressing the customer's confusion about the dates and settlement percentages. The agent should have clarified the dates and percentages clearly to resolve the customer's confusion.

The agent also fails to acknowledge the customer's frustration or provide reassurance, which could have helped calm the situation. Instead of interrupting, the agent should have used calming phrases like ""I understand your concern, let me clarify this for you.""

**Improvement Suggestion**: The agent could have said, ""I understand you have a question about stop loss.

The agent explained that in BTST trading, funds are not released on the same day but on the settlement date, which in this case would be the next day. The agent reassured Anmol that the funds would be available for trading by the next day and advised him to add additional funds if needed for trading. Anmol also inquired about canceling the order, to which the agent explained that since the stock had already been sold, it could not be canceled. The agent provided clarification on the fund release process in BTST trading and advised Anmol on how to proceed with his trading activities.","[{'query': ""I placed an order yesterday and tried to execute it today, but it didn't happen.

The actual response explains the process of After Market Orders (AMO) and why the order might not have been executed before 9:15 AM. However, the agent's response talks about an order executed at 11:06 and mentions trading balance visibility, which is not relevant to the customer's query about AMO execution timing.

Marks were deducted for the following reasons:
- The agent did not address the customer's concern about the timing of AMO execution (deducted 4 points).
- The agent provided information about order execution and trading balance that was not relevant to the customer's question (deducted 3 points).
- The response could confuse the customer as it does not align with the knowledge base information about AMO orders (deducted 1 point).

To improve, the agent should have explained the AMO process, including the timing of order execution, as described in the actual response. The agent's response is largely incorrect and does not align with the actual response or the likely issue the customer is facing. The actual response suggests that the issue might be due to a technical problem or delay, and advises the customer to contact CFS support for accurate information. However, the agent's response incorrectly explains the trading balance visibility based on settlement dates, which is not relevant to the customer's issue of the balance not showing at all. This misdirection could lead to customer confusion and does not resolve the issue, hence the score of 2 for providing a response that doesn't align with the knowledge base or customer issue. The agent's response is inaccurate and lacks key details. The actual response provides multiple potential reasons for the delay in fund release, such as the payout not being due, new positions affecting the balance, or open positions incurring losses. It also advises the customer to review recent transactions and positions and offers further assistance through customer support.

In contrast, the agent's response only addresses a specific scenario related to BTST trading and does not consider other possible reasons for the delay. This could lead to customer confusion if their situation does not involve BTST trading. The agent's response is too narrow and misses the broader context provided in the actual response.

To improve, the agent should have included the various potential reasons for the delay and suggested reviewing transactions and positions, as well as offering further assistance if needed. The agent's response is partially accurate but has gaps that could lead to customer confusion or require follow-up questions. 

1. The agent correctly states that the sale cannot be canceled, aligning with the actual response. 

2. However, the agent introduces information about fund release and shortfall for another purchase, which is not relevant to the customer's question about canceling a stock sale. This could confuse the customer as it deviates from the main issue.

3. The agent fails to emphasize the finality of the transaction and the importance of considering decisions before executing a sale, which is a key part of the actual response.

To improve, the agent should focus solely on the finality of the stock sale transaction and avoid introducing unrelated information about fund release and shortfall, ensuring the customer understands the irreversibility of the sale. The agent's response is only somewhat correct and misses major details. The agent correctly identifies that the balance is not available for trading, but fails to provide any explanation or reasoning behind why this might be the case. The actual response suggests several potential reasons for the balance not being available, such as open positions with MTM losses or outstanding charges, which the agent does not mention. Additionally, the agent does not advise the customer to review their account statements or contact customer support for further assistance, which are key steps in resolving the issue. This lack of detail and guidance could lead to customer confusion and an unresolved issue, hence the score of 4.",2,"The agent, Aman, did not fully adhere to the provided script.

   - **What the agent said:** ""Good morning, I am Aman from Choice Broking. How can I help you?""
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Good Morning, this is Aman calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"" This would ensure consistency with the company name and script.

2. **Verification:**
   - The agent did not perform any verification of the customer's identity, which is crucial for security and personalization.

While the agent does address the customer's issue and provides technical explanations, there is a lack of empathetic language and understanding of the customer's emotions.

1. The agent does not use any empathetic phrases such as ""I understand your concern"" or ""I can see why this is frustrating,"" which would have shown a deeper understanding of the customer's feelings.

2. The agent's responses are very technical and lack personalization. For example, when the customer expresses confusion about the trading balance, the agent could have said, ""I understand this can be confusing, let me help clarify this for you,"" instead of just explaining the technical process.

3. The agent missed opportunities to reassure the customer or express understanding of their situation. For instance, when the customer mentions they wanted to do something else with the funds, the agent could have acknowledged this by saying, ""I see, it can be frustrating when things don't go as planned.

Can you tell me?"" without letting the customer finish their explanation. A better approach would have been to say, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

2. **Failure to Reconfirm the Query:** The agent did not effectively reconfirm the customer's query. The customer mentioned issues with the trading balance not showing in CFS, but the agent did not summarize or confirm this specific concern before proceeding with a solution. The agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the issue of the trading balance not showing in CFS after executing an order. Let me check that for you.""

3. **Providing a Solution Without Full Understanding:** The agent provided a solution regarding BTST and fund release without fully understanding the customer's initial concern about the trading balance not showing. The agent should have first ensured they understood the customer's problem before offering a solution.

Firstly, the agent does not explicitly acknowledge the customer's frustration or confusion at any point. Phrases like ""I understand your concern"" or ""I see how this can be confusing"" could have been used to show empathy and further calm the customer. 

Secondly, while the agent provides information, he could have been more proactive in ensuring the customer fully understood the explanation, perhaps by asking if the customer had any more questions or needed further clarification.

The actual response suggests checking transaction history or contacting support to confirm if the order has been sold, while the agent incorrectly confirms the order has been executed and mentions a document (820T) that is not referenced in the actual response. This could lead to customer confusion as it assumes the order status without verification. The agent should have guided the customer to check their transaction history or contact support for confirmation, as per the actual response. The agent's response is inaccurate and lacks key details. The actual response addresses two potential customer concerns: the time it takes for a withdrawal to be credited and the absence of a minimum balance requirement. The agent's response only partially addresses the withdrawal timing, using terms like 'T plus 1 day' and 'T plus 2', which may not be clear to the customer. Additionally, the agent fails to mention the important detail about the absence of a minimum balance requirement, which is a significant part of the actual response. This omission could lead to customer confusion or the need for further clarification. To improve, the agent should clearly explain the withdrawal process and also address the minimum balance requirement, as outlined in the actual response. The agent's response is in the wrong direction compared to the actual response. The actual response indicates that there is no direct answer to the user's query and asks for more details to provide assistance. However, the agent incorrectly assures the customer that no further action is needed and that the money will be settled the next day. This assurance is not supported by the information in the actual response, which suggests that more context is needed to provide a proper solution. The agent's response could lead to customer confusion or frustration if the issue is not related to a financial transaction as assumed by the agent. To improve, the agent should have asked for more details about the specific process or action the customer is referring to, as suggested in the actual response. The agent's response is completely incorrect and does not address the customer's issue as described in the actual response. The actual response explains that the negative profit and loss is due to the current market value of positions being lower than the invested value, and suggests reviewing trade details in the Positions Tab to understand the negative P&L. The agent, however, incorrectly attributes the negative P&L to charges decided by the settlement team, which is not relevant to the customer's issue. This misdirection could lead to customer frustration and does not provide a solution to the problem. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 1, as it is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.",2,"The agent did not fully adhere to the provided script. Here are the areas where the agent missed following the script and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Greeting:**
   - The agent did not start the call with the appropriate greeting as per the script.

   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification:**
   - The agent did ask for the client's name, which is good, but did not follow the script's structure for verification.
   - **What the agent said:** ""Please confirm your name first.""
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""May I confirm, is this Mr. Saltish Mohanlal speaking?""

3. **Listening to the Query:**
   - The agent did listen to the customer's query but did not use the script's suggested phrases to encourage the customer to explain their concern.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query:**
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's query to confirm understanding.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution:**
   - The agent provided a solution but could have structured it more clearly as per the script.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries:**
   - The agent did not mention the TAT for resolution or callback requests.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT (Turnaround Time) for resolution.""

   - The agent did not use the script's closure phrases.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

   - The agent did not request feedback as per the script.
   - **What the agent could have said:** ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not start the call with the prescribed greeting. Instead, the conversation began abruptly without any formal introduction or greeting. The agent should have started with, ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification**: The agent did not follow the verification process as outlined in the script. The script requires the agent to confirm the identity of the caller, especially if the number is not registered. The agent should have asked for verification details if the number was not registered.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail, nor did they demonstrate active listening as per the script. The agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize the customer's query to confirm understanding, which is a crucial step in ensuring clarity and accuracy.

5. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent did provide some information, it was not clear or concise as required by the script. The explanation about the settlement process was confusing and not well-structured.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**: The agent did not mention any Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues, which is an important part of managing customer expectations.

7. **Closure**: The agent did not properly close the call by asking if there was anything else they could assist with or thanking the customer for their time.

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: The agent did not inform the customer about the feedback request, which is a missed opportunity for gathering customer insights.

The conversation starts directly with the customer expressing a concern about a share transaction, and the agent responds by asking for confirmation of the customer's name.

A proper greeting sets a positive tone for the conversation and helps in building rapport with the customer.

1. **Lack of Initial Acknowledgment**: The agent did not start the conversation by inviting the customer to explain their issue in detail. A better approach would have been to say, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

2. **Interruption and Lack of Clarification**: The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the customer's query before proceeding to check the order status. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are asking if your order has been sold. Let me check that for you.""

3. **Failure to Address Customer's Confusion**: When the customer expressed confusion about the term ""executed,"" the agent repeated the term without explaining it in simpler terms. The agent could have said, ""Executed means your order has been completed and the shares have been sold.""

4. **Incomplete Explanation of Settlement Process**: The agent provided a vague explanation of the settlement process without ensuring the customer understood. A more effective response would have been, ""The settlement process takes T plus 1 day, which means your funds will be available by tomorrow.""

5. **Ignoring Customer's Concern About Profit and Loss**: The customer expressed concern about the profit and loss showing as negative, but the agent did not address this directly. Instead, the agent should have explained, ""The negative figures you see are due to brokerage charges and taxes, which are deducted from your profit.""

The agent also fails to provide a clear explanation of the charges and settlement process, which could have been an opportunity to reassure the customer.

The actual response indicates that the query might be related to personal financial transactions or accounting, which is not covered in the provided documents. The agent, however, assumes a specific scenario about selling goods and settlement times, which is not mentioned or relevant to the customer's query. This could lead to confusion for the customer as it does not address their actual concern. The agent should have acknowledged the lack of information in the documents and suggested that the query might be outside the scope of the available resources, as the actual response did.

The agent's response is incomplete and misses several key points that are necessary to fully address the customer's query about the discrepancy in their trading account balance. 

1. **Incomplete Explanation**: The agent only mentions that the funds from today's sale have not been received, which is a partial explanation. The actual response provides a comprehensive list of potential reasons for the discrepancy, including market fluctuations, charges and fees, margin requirements, and order execution issues. 

2. **Lack of Detail**: The agent does not advise the customer to review their transaction history or contact their broker for a detailed breakdown, which are important steps to resolve the issue.

3. **Missing Context**: The agent's response lacks context about other factors that could affect the balance, such as pending orders or fees, which are crucial for the customer to understand the situation fully.

Overall, the agent's response leaves the issue unresolved and requires the customer to seek further clarification, which is why it scores a 5 for being incomplete. The agent's response is largely incorrect and does not align with the actual solution provided in the knowledge base. The actual response should have informed the customer about the typical processing time for funds to be credited, which is usually within 24 hours after the withdrawal is processed. Instead, the agent's response seems to address a different issue related to MTF balance and current transactions, which is not relevant to the customer's query about the timing of fund credits. This misdirection could lead to customer confusion and frustration, hence the low score of 2.

   - **Improvement:** The agent should have asked, ""May I confirm, is this Mr. [Customer's Name] speaking?"" or followed the non-registered number verification process if applicable.

3. **Listening to the Query:**
   - The agent did listen to the customer's query but did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail as per the script.
   - **Improvement:** The agent could have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query:**
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's issue to confirm understanding.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution:**
   - The agent attempted to provide a solution but did not clearly communicate the resolution or any next steps.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have clearly stated, ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries:**
   - There was no mention of a Turnaround Time (TAT) for resolution if the issue was not resolved during the call.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have informed the customer, ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT for resolution.""

7. **Closure:**
   - The agent did not properly close the call with a script-aligned closure.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have asked, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"" and then thanked the customer, ""Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!""

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT):**
   - The agent did not request feedback at the end of the call.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

Overall, the agent needs to follow the script more closely to ensure a professional and consistent customer service experience.","The agent's adherence to the script was poor, with several key areas of the script not followed:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not follow the script's greeting format. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?"", the agent simply said, ""Good morning, sir. How are you?"" This lacks the professional introduction and the company's name, which is crucial for setting the context of the call.

2. **Verification**: There was no attempt to verify the customer's identity, which is a critical step in the script. The agent should have confirmed the customer's identity by asking, ""May I confirm, is this Mr. XYZ speaking?"" or verified details if it was a non-registered number.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did listen to the customer's query, but the conversation was disorganized and lacked structure. The agent should have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you,"" to guide the conversation more effectively.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the customer's issue, which is important to ensure understanding. The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution**: The agent attempted to provide a solution but did not communicate it clearly or concisely. The agent should have thanked the customer for their patience and provided a clear solution.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**: There was no mention of a Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues, which is a critical part of managing customer expectations.

7. **Closure and Feedback Request**: The call ended abruptly without a proper closure or feedback request. The agent should have asked, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"" and informed the customer about the feedback request.

Overall, the agent missed several key components of the script, leading to a disorganized and less professional interaction. Improvements in following the script more closely would enhance the quality of the call.",0,"The agent did not provide a proper greeting at the beginning of the call. The conversation starts directly with 'Good morning, sir. How are you?' which is informal and lacks the necessary introduction of the agent and the company. A proper greeting should include the agent's name and the company they are representing, as well as an offer to assist the customer. For example, the agent could have said, 'Good morning, this is [Agent's Name] from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?' This would have set a professional tone for the call and provided the customer with clear information about who they are speaking with.",2,"The agent in this transcript demonstrates minimal empathy. The conversation is primarily focused on the technical details of the customer's account and transactions, with little to no acknowledgment of the customer's frustration or confusion. The agent does not use any empathetic language or phrases to show understanding of the customer's situation. For example, when the customer expresses confusion about the minus balance, the agent could have said, ""I understand this situation can be confusing, let me help clarify it for you,"" instead of just stating the facts. The agent's responses are mostly factual and do not address the customer's emotions or concerns, which is why the score is a 2.",0,"The agent did not provide any closure to the customer. The conversation ended abruptly without any attempt to summarize the discussion or offer further assistance. The agent failed to ask if there was anything else the customer needed help with or to thank the customer for their time. The exact closure phrase was not present in the transcript. Instead, the agent could have said, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!' to provide proper closure.",,0,"The agent did not demonstrate effective listening skills throughout the interaction. Here are the reasons for the score:

1. **Lack of Clarification and Reconfirmation:** The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the customer's query at any point. For example, after the customer explained the issue with the minus balance, the agent should have said something like, ""Just to confirm, you are concerned about a minus balance of Rs. 34,000 after selling goods worth Rs. 120,000 today. Let me check that for you."" This would have shown that the agent was actively listening and understood the customer's concern.

2. **Interruptions and Lack of Empathy:** The agent frequently interrupted the customer and did not allow them to fully express their concerns. For instance, when the customer was explaining the issue with the minus balance, the agent immediately asked, ""When did you sell it, sir? Today?"" without letting the customer finish their explanation. A better approach would have been to let the customer finish and then ask clarifying questions if needed.

3. **Failure to Provide a Clear Solution:** The agent did not provide a clear and concise solution to the customer's problem. The conversation ended with the customer still confused about the minus balance and the status of their funds. The agent should have clearly explained the process and timeline for the funds to be reflected in the account.

Overall, the agent's responses indicate a lack of active listening and understanding of the customer's issue, which is why the score is 0.",3,"The agent maintains a polite tone throughout the conversation and attempts to address the customer's concerns. However, there are several instances where the agent could have better acknowledged the customer's frustration or provided clearer explanations. For example, the agent repeatedly says ""Sir, he hasn't come yet"" and ""I can't see him,"" which might sound dismissive or unclear to the customer. The agent could have instead said, ""I understand this is frustrating, let me check the details for you,"" to show empathy and provide reassurance. Additionally, the agent seems to be struggling to provide a clear resolution or explanation, which might contribute to the customer's frustration. Overall, the agent's control is average, as they remain polite but miss opportunities to calm the customer and clarify the situation more effectively.",1,2.61/9*

The agent provided specific brokerage rates and charges for options and commodities, which were not mentioned in the actual response. The actual response detailed various charges related to Choice Techlab, HUF accounts, IPO applications, and collateral charges, none of which were addressed by the agent.

The agent's response is in the wrong direction as it focuses on brokerage rates and charges for options and commodities, which are not relevant to the customer's query as per the actual response. This could lead to customer confusion and frustration, as the agent did not address the specific charges mentioned in the actual response.

To improve, the agent should have provided a detailed breakdown of the charges collected from each side as outlined in the actual response, including RMS Square Off Charge, Invocation Charge, Stamp Duty, DP Charge, and the specifics of HUF account charges and IPO application charges. The agent's response is completely incorrect and does not align with the actual solution provided in the knowledge base. The agent incorrectly confirmed an email ID without following the proper steps to retrieve it, as outlined in the actual response. Additionally, the agent suggested modifying the email ID through the application, which is not mentioned in the actual response. This could lead to customer frustration or escalation, as the customer was not given the correct procedure to find their email ID associated with their Choice account. The correct solution involves contacting the support team via email or the support website to retrieve the login ID, which can then be used to access the account and view the email ID. The agent's response fails to address these steps entirely, warranting a score of 1. The agent's response is partially accurate but has some gaps and inaccuracies compared to the actual response. 

1. The agent correctly instructs the customer to go to the application and click on the profile, which aligns with the actual response's first two steps.

2. However, the agent introduces unnecessary steps such as entering the client name and verifying the OTP, which are not mentioned in the actual response. This could confuse the customer.

3. The agent mentions that the update will take 24 hours to process, which is not specified in the actual response. This could set incorrect expectations for the customer.

4. The agent fails to mention the option to contact the support team via email if the customer encounters difficulties, which is a crucial part of the actual response.

Overall, the agent's response is mostly correct but includes unnecessary steps and misses important details, requiring the customer to potentially seek further clarification. The agent's response is largely incorrect and does not align with the actual solution provided in the knowledge base. The actual response indicates that the customer can access their statement directly through the Choice App by logging in and navigating to the 'Holding' section. However, the agent incorrectly advises the customer to update their email ID and then request the statement via email, which is not mentioned in the actual response. This misdirection could lead to customer confusion and unnecessary steps, hence the score of 2 for providing a response that doesn't align with the correct solution. The agent's response diverges significantly from the actual response. The actual response indicates that there is no specific information available about using WhatsApp or sending text messages for communication with Choice Techlab. However, the agent incorrectly states that WhatsApp is not allowed and provides an email address and an alternative method for communication, which is not mentioned in the actual response.

Marks were deducted for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Information (WhatsApp not allowed)**: The agent incorrectly states that WhatsApp is not allowed, which is not supported by the actual response. This misinformation could mislead the customer. 

2. **Providing Unverified Contact Information**: The agent provides an email address and suggests using a support section, which is not mentioned in the actual response. This could lead to further confusion if the information is incorrect or not applicable.

3. **Deviation from Actual Response**: The agent's response does not align with the actual response, which simply states the lack of specific information on the topic.

To improve, the agent should have stated that there is no specific information available regarding the use of WhatsApp or text messages for communication with Choice Techlab, as per the actual response. This would have been more accurate and aligned with the provided information.",2,"The agent did not fully adhere to the provided script. Here are the areas where the agent missed following the script and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Greeting:**
   - The agent started with ""Good morning, sir. How are you?"" which is not in line with the script.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Good Morning, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification:**
   - The agent did not perform any verification of the customer's identity, which is crucial for security and personalization.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have asked, ""May I confirm, is this Mr. [Customer's Name] speaking?"" or if it was a non-registered number, proceed with the identity verification process as outlined in the script.

3. **Listening to the Query:**
   - The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail.
   - **Improvement:** The agent could have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query:**
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's query to confirm understanding.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution:**
   - The agent provided information but did not clearly state it as a solution or thank the customer for their patience.
   - **Improvement:** The agent could have said, ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries:**
   - The agent did not mention any Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues or callback requests.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have informed the customer about the TAT, saying, ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT for resolution.""

7. **Closure:**
   - The agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with before ending the call.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Is there anything else I can assist you with today?""

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT):**
   - The agent did not request feedback at the end of the call.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

By adhering to the script, the agent can provide a more structured and effective interaction with the customer.","The agent's adherence to the script was poor, with several key areas of the script not followed:

1. **Greeting**: The agent did not use the prescribed greeting from the script. Instead of saying, ""Good Morning, this is ABC calling from Choice Finx.

2. **Verification**: There was no attempt to verify the customer's identity, which is a critical step in the script. The agent should have confirmed the customer's identity by asking for specific details as per the script.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail, nor did they demonstrate active listening as per the script's guidance.

4. **Reconfirming the Query**: The agent did not summarize the customer's issue to confirm understanding, which is an important step to ensure clarity and accuracy in addressing the customer's concerns.

5. **Providing a Solution**: While the agent did provide some information, it was not structured or clear as per the script's guidelines. The agent should have clearly stated the solution after confirming the query.

6. **TAT for Pending Queries**: There was no mention of Turnaround Time (TAT) for unresolved issues, which is a critical part of managing customer expectations.

7. **Closure**: The agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with, nor did they thank the customer for their time, which is essential for a professional closure.

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT)**: The agent did not inform the customer about the feedback request, missing an opportunity to gather valuable customer insights.

1. **Misunderstanding the Query**: The customer initially asked about 'loggerhead charges,' but the agent misunderstood this as 'delivery charges.' The agent should have clarified the term 'loggerhead charges' instead of assuming it was delivery charges. A better response would have been, ""Could you please clarify what you mean by loggerhead charges?""

2. **Failure to Reconfirm the Query**: The agent did not reconfirm the customer's query about brokerage charges clearly. The customer repeatedly asked about the charges, and the agent's responses were confusing and inconsistent. The agent should have summarized the charges clearly and confirmed with the customer, ""Just to confirm, you are asking about the brokerage charges for different types of trades, correct?""

3. **Providing Incomplete Information**: The customer expressed confusion about the brokerage rates and the process for updating the email ID. The agent provided fragmented information and did not ensure the customer fully understood the process. The agent should have said, ""Let me walk you through the steps again to ensure everything is clear.""

4. **Not Addressing Customer's Frustration**: The customer expressed frustration about potential fraud and high charges, but the agent did not acknowledge or address these concerns empathetically.

However, the agent asked for a screenshot of the error page, which is not relevant to resolving the issue. This approach does not address the customer's problem and could lead to unnecessary delays and customer frustration. The agent should have explained that pledged shares cannot be lent under SLBM and advised the customer to unpledge the shares first to proceed with pledging them successfully. The agent's response is rated a 2 because it does not align with the actual solution provided in the knowledge base. The agent asked for the registered mobile number, which is not relevant to resolving the issue of updating the phone number.

The agent's response is rated a 2 because it is in the wrong direction and does not align with the actual solution provided in the knowledge base.

The agent's response is completely incorrect and does not align with the actual solution provided in the knowledge base. The agent incorrectly states that they cannot solve the problem without access to the online account, which is not the issue at hand.

The agent's response fails to address the customer's needs and provides no useful information, leading to potential customer frustration. Therefore, the score is 1, as the response is entirely incorrect. The agent's response is incomplete and misses key steps necessary to resolve the customer's issue. The actual response suggests that the customer should reach out to the customer service team for assistance with onboarding-related services, including address changes and early redemption.

Therefore, the response deserves a score of 2, as it does not address the customer's query correctly and could potentially mislead the customer.",2,"The agent did not fully adhere to the provided script. Here are the areas where the agent missed following the script and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Greeting:**
   - The agent started with ""Good afternoon, sir. Can you please tell me how I can help you?"" instead of the script's recommended greeting.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Good Afternoon, this is [Agent's Name] calling from Choice Finx. How may I assist you today?""

2. **Verification:**
   - The agent did not follow the verification process as outlined in the script. The agent asked for the registered mobile number but did not confirm the identity using the other details as required for non-registered numbers.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""I see that the number you are calling from is not registered in our system. To proceed, we will need to verify your identity by confirming 3 out of the following 5 details: Mobile Number, PAN, Date of Birth, Address, Holding (any one script name).""

3. **Listening to the Query:**
   - The agent did not explicitly invite the customer to explain their concern in detail or assure them that they are there to listen and assist.
   - **Improvement:** The agent could have said, ""Please feel free to explain your concern in detail. Iâ€™m here to listen and assist you.""

4. **Reconfirming the Query:**
   - The agent did not summarize the customer's query to confirm understanding.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Just to confirm, you are facing the following issue: [briefly summarize the query]. Let me check that for you.""

5. **Providing a Solution:**
   - The agent did not clearly provide a solution or explain the next steps in a structured manner.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""Thank you for your patience. Based on your query, here is the solution: [provide clear and concise solution].""

6. **TAT for Pending Queries:**
   - The agent did not mention the Turnaround Time (TAT) for resolution or callback requests.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""If the issue is not resolved during this call, I will provide you with a TAT (Turnaround Time) for resolution. For any callback requests, we will ensure to contact you within 2 hours, either from my end or a senior agent's end.""

7. **Closure:**
   - The agent did not ask if there was anything else they could assist with before ending the call.

8. **Feedback Request (CSAT):**
   - The agent did not request feedback at the end of the call.
   - **Improvement:** The agent should have said, ""After this call, you will receive a message to rate our service. We would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback to help us improve our services.""

How may I assist you today?"", the agent said, ""Good afternoon, sir. Can you please tell me how I can help you?"" This lacks the personal touch and the company introduction. 
   - **Improvement**: The agent should use the full greeting as per the script to ensure professionalism and brand consistency.

2. **Verification**: The agent did not follow the verification process correctly. The script requires confirming the identity by asking for specific details if the number is not registered. The agent asked for the registered mobile number but did not follow up with the other verification details as required.
   - **Improvement**: The agent should ask for three out of the five verification details if the number is not registered, as per the script.

3. **Listening to the Query**: The agent did not allow the customer to fully express their concerns without interruption. The conversation was disjointed, and the agent did not summarize the query effectively.
   - **Improvement**: The agent should let the customer finish speaking and then summarize the issue to confirm understanding.

4. **Providing a Solution**: The agent did not provide a clear solution or a TAT for unresolved issues. The conversation ended without a clear resolution or next steps.
   - **Improvement**: The agent should provide a clear solution or a TAT if the issue cannot be resolved immediately.

5. **Closure and Feedback Request**: The agent did not follow the closure script or request feedback. The call ended abruptly without thanking the customer or asking for feedback.
   - **Improvement**: The agent should close the call by asking if there is anything else they can assist with, thank the customer, and request feedback as per the script.

Additionally, when the customer mentions previous issues and lack of response, the agent could have shown empathy by saying, ""I'm sorry to hear that you've had trouble getting a response, let's make sure we get this sorted out for you.""

1. **Initial Query Misunderstanding**: The customer mentioned two issues: pledging shares and a phone number problem. The agent did not acknowledge the phone number issue at all and focused only on the pledging issue. 
   - **Improvement**: The agent could have said, ""I understand you are facing issues with pledging your shares and also with your phone number. Let me assist you with both.""

2. **Failure to Reconfirm the Query**: The agent did not summarize or reconfirm the customer's issues before proceeding with solutions. This led to confusion and the customer repeating themselves.
   - **Improvement**: ""Just to confirm, you are unable to pledge your shares and there is an issue with your registered phone number. Is that correct?""

3. **Providing Irrelevant Solutions**: The agent asked for a screenshot and suggested attaching files without understanding the customer's previous attempts and frustrations.
   - **Improvement**: ""I see you've already sent attachments. Let me check our records for any received files and follow up on the ticket status.""

4. **Lack of Empathy and Assurance**: The agent did not provide any assurance or empathy towards the customer's repeated issues and frustrations.

Instead, the agent's responses are somewhat mechanical and lack personalization, such as when they say, ""We can't solve your problem. You can close your account,"" which could be perceived as dismissive.

For example, when the customer expressed confusion about the process, the agent could have said, ""I understand this can be a bit confusing, let me guide you through the steps,"" instead of simply stating, ""You have to do everything."" This would have shown more empathy and understanding. Additionally, the agent's responses were quite abrupt and lacked personalization, which contributed to the low empathy score.",0,"The agent did not provide proper closure to the call. The conversation ended abruptly with the customer saying 'Okay. Thank you.' and the agent simply responding with 'Okay.' There was no attempt by the agent to ensure that the customer had all the information they needed or to offer further assistance. The agent failed to ask if there was anything else the customer needed help with, which is a crucial part of providing closure. Additionally, the agent did not thank the customer for their time or wish them a good day, which are important elements of a courteous and professional closure. The agent could have improved the closure by saying something like, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Thank you for your time on the call. Have a wonderful day!' This would have ensured the customer felt valued and that their needs were fully addressed.",0,0,"The agent, Shaya, did not demonstrate effective listening skills in the interaction with the customer. Here are the reasons for the score:

1. **Initial Misunderstanding**: The agent misunderstood the customer's initial query. The customer clearly stated, ""Sir, I want to open a new account. What is the procedure?"" However, the agent responded with, ""What, sir? You want to close an account?"" This indicates a lack of attention to the customer's words. Instead, the agent could have said, ""Just to confirm, you want to open a new account. Let me guide you through the process.""

2. **Lack of Reconfirmation**: The agent did not reconfirm the customer's query after the initial misunderstanding. A good practice would be to summarize the customer's request to ensure clarity, such as, ""Just to confirm, you are looking to open a new account. Is that correct?""

3. **Incomplete Information**: The agent provided fragmented information about the process without ensuring the customer fully understood each step. The customer asked, ""Can you tell me what the fourth process is?"" indicating confusion, but the agent did not clarify or provide a structured explanation. A better approach would be, ""Let me walk you through the steps one by one to ensure everything is clear.""

Overall, the agent failed to listen actively and respond appropriately to the customer's needs, resulting in a score of 0.",3,"The agent, Shaya, maintains a polite tone throughout the conversation but shows signs of being rushed and slightly impatient. For example, when the customer initially states they want to open a new account, Shaya mishears and asks if they want to close an account, which could indicate a lack of attentiveness. Additionally, Shaya's responses are somewhat abrupt and lack empathy, such as when they say, ""You have to do everything,"" which could be perceived as dismissive. Instead, Shaya could have said, ""I understand it might seem like a lot, but let me guide you through each step."" This would have shown more patience and understanding. Overall, while Shaya remains polite, they miss opportunities to acknowledge the customer's needs more empathetically and to ensure the customer feels supported throughout the process.",1,4.8/10*
